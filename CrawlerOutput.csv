The company, Xycrobe Therapeutics, has been at the incubator since 2014.

The partners plan to apply Xycrobe s tech, which includes a library of bacterial strains that have a symbiotic relationship living on human skin. The La Jolla, CA-based company has developed several strains of these commensal skin bacteria that could reduce skin inflammation, including in diseases including acne, psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema.

Interestingly, the deal is with J&J s Consumer business, rather than its drug development arm Janssen.

""The current paradigm for treating skin conditions, such as acne, completely disregards the importance of the commensal skin flora. Overuse of antibiotics have led to a higher prevalence of resistant strains of bacteria and along with that comes less efficacy for conventional treatments. So, we are attempting to change that paradigm,"" said Xycrobe founder and CEO Thomas Hitchcock in a statement.

He continued, ""We feel that the key to better treatment solutions for skin disease lies in understanding our body's interaction with the skin microbiome, and how we can leverage this information. 

Xycrobe expects to pursue programs related to various skin issues including hair loss and toenail fungus, but its initial focus is on these inflammatory skin diseases.

Johnson & Johnson has been actively pursuing microbiome-based treatments. It has created the Janssen Human Microbiome Institute (JHMI) specifically to pursue such research. It has research centers in Cambridge, MA and Beerse, Belgium.

The pharma has done some deals on the microbiome front including a pair that are both focused on inflammatory bowel disease one with Cambridge, MA-based Vedanta Biosciences and the other with South San Francisco, CA-based Second Genome.

The Vedanta deal, which dates from last year, was Janssen s first to in-license a microbiome therapeutic candidate.

It s for an indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide; the prior designation is for treatment-resistant depression, which the pharma received in November 2013.

Esketamine could offer another option to treat depression, which is underserved and has seen scant innovation in decades. It s an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist--and an isomer of the generic anesthetic and notorious party drug ketamine. The intranasal formulation offers fast-acting benefits, unlike standard oral treatment approaches.

J&J has high expectations for esketamine, which it listed last year among the more than 10 late-stage products that it expects could become blockbusters with over $1 billion in sales. The candidate was the only neurology candidate in this list, all of which the pharma expects could be approved before 2020. Neuroscience is one of J&J s five core therapeutic areas.

 What we found was again spectacular results where patients who were refractory to most antidepressants when they go on esketamine within days, their improvement in mood is dramatic and somewhat unpredictable,  said William Hait, J&J s Janssen Global Head of Research & Development on a conference call in early May describing data on the candidate.  The duration of the effect is much longer than one might have predicted from the half-life of the drug. So very rapid improvement in mood, not the weeks and sometimes even months to take SSRI or tricyclic. So very rapid and long duration. 

Phase III data for the treatment-resistant depression indication is expected in late 2017. The Phase II data to support the breakthrough designation in major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide was reported in May at the Society of Biological Psychiatry conference.

Hait added,  The study was done in patients who come to the emergency room, they've attempted suicide or about to attempt and someone rescues them. They get admitted to the hospital for standard treatment plus or minus esketamine. And what we saw again, within days, a dramatic improvement in the mood of these patients and a decrease in suicide ideology. 

Ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression patients, a practice that s increasing according to a recent Leerink note based on interviews with a trio of depression physician specialists.

And J&J is not alone in targeting NMDA for depression. Allergan ($AGN) is also developing intravenous rapastinel, which is in Phase III and oral AGN-241660, which is in Phase II, both of which are NMDA modulators.

The specialists interviewed by Leerink viewed rapastinel and esketamine as the most promising NMDA modulators to treat depression due to Phase II data showing a rapid onset of action and limited psychotomimetic side effects; the latter is an issue with off-label ketamine use.

The addition of a Brisbane, CA headquarters was sparked by the hire of experienced biotech exec John Donovan to head the company.

Donovan s last endeavor, viral disease play Alios BioPharma, was sold to Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) for about $1.75 billion near the end of 2014. He founded that company and served as its CBO and CFO. Donovan remained with J&J through the end of 2015. He started out as a Wall Street banker, before transitioning to the corporate side with a job at InterMune prior to its acquisition by Roche ($RHHBY).

Tioma started out as Vasculox in 2006 and until now has survived on some small seed rounds. It plans to use its $86 million Series A to advance it lead candidate, an anti-CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitor, through advanced proof-of-concept clinical trials.

The financing attracted a trio of strategic players: It was co-led by RiverVest Venture Partners, Novo Ventures, Roche Venture Fund and GlaxoSmithKline s ($GSK) corporate venture arm S.R. One.

 We find CD47 to be an extremely interesting target in the evolving cancer immunotherapy landscape,  said Novo Ventures Partner Peter Moldt in a statement.  Tioma Therapeutics, with its portfolio of diverse, functionally heterogeneous antibodies, is well positioned to test the CD47 hypothesis in the clinic. 

Tioma aims to treat solid and hematologic cancers. The startup expects that its anti-CD47 antibody approach could have the potential to promote two different aspects of the immune system: the innate and the adaptive immune response. The innate response is an initial, non-specific defense mechanism that is activated by the chemical properties of an antigen, but the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and, therefore, more complex.

The company counts William Frazier, a professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics, Cell Biology, and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University School of Medicine, amongst its scientific founders. He was key in the discovery that CD47 is a receptor for thrombospondin-1. Tioma will keep its St. Louis research labs.

The study will give Astex Pharmaceuticals  DNMT inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy.

In the first phase of the study, CRUK, working out of its clinical trial unit in Southampton, U.K., will give small doses of the DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine to up to 36 patients with advanced solid tumors. In doing so, CRUK expects to confirm the safety of the drug and identify the most effective dose, setting it up to advance into the second phase of the clinical trial. This second phase represents the critical stage for the program.

CRUK plans to enroll 20 patients with bladder cancer who are scheduled to have three or four cycles of chemotherapy before undergoing surgery. Some of the participants will be randomized to receive this standard-of-care treatment. Another cohort will receive the cycles of chemotherapy plus Astex s experimental DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine, also known as SGI-110. Preclinical research suggests the combination could be more effective than chemotherapy alone.

This line of thinking is underpinned by knowledge of the mechanism of action of guadecitabine and the process that causes bladder cancers to develop resistance to chemotherapy. As DNMTs facilitate epigenetic modifications that researchers have for decades linked to the development of resistance to chemotherapy, CRUK is hoping the inhibition of the process will result in tumors of patients in the guadecitabine arm remaining more susceptible to the standard-of-care treatment.

CRUK is running the trial as part of the Combinations Alliance, an initiative that brings the nonprofit together with the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres Network and drug developers to see which treatments work well when given together. In this instance, the drug developer is Astex, a biotech run out of Cambridge, U.K. and Pleasanton, CA, that was bought out by Otsuka for $886 million ( 786 million) in 2013.

Astex has advanced guadecitabine furthest down the pipeline as a treatment for blood cancers--in April it teamed with Genentech for an anti-PD-L1 combination study in acute myeloid leukemia--but it has also explored its effect on solid tumors. Many of the solid tumor trials, like the CRUK study, are sponsored by third parties that want to assess the effect of guadecitabine in combination with other drugs in indications such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.

Other trials for VX-661, its lead pipeline drug, are still ongoing, but it has stopped its combo Phase III study in a small subpopulation of patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a mutation that results in minimal CFTR protein function (F508del het/min).

This comes after an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, which said that the results it had seen did not warrant further tests. Vertex noted that there were not however any safety issues coming out of the study.

The company will push on with other studies for the two meds, though, and said that this week it had just finished enrollment for the study of VX-661 and Kalydeco in people with two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del homozygous).

Another trial, which will enroll people with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a residual function mutation, should also be completed by September, the company said in a statement.

 While we recognize that people with CF with minimal function mutations have a form of the disease that is particularly difficult to treat, we believed it was important to evaluate whether a dual combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor could provide some benefit to these patients given they do not today have a medicine to treat the cause of their disease,  said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, EVP and chief medical officer at Vertex.

 These results suggest that a triple combination regimen may provide this group of people with CF the best chance at obtaining a meaningful benefit and we look forward to beginning the first study of a next-generation corrector together with VX-661 and ivacaftor in this group of patients later this year, pending data from our ongoing Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. 

Vertex said despite this setback, it still expects to submit an NDA to the FDA for a Kalydeco/VX-661 cocktail treatment in the second half of 2017, pending data from its remaining Phase III trials. The NDA will include data from the study in people with minimal function mutations, the company added.

Vertex already has a combo CF treatment on the market in the form of Orkambi (ivacaftor and lumacaftor), which has a U.S. license for CF in patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene.

Analysts at Jefferies did not see the dropping of one of the studies as terminal to its CF pipeline, saying in a note to clients,  We believe expectations were low [for this subpopulation], and this does not change our overall positive CF franchise view. 

But Jefferies said that the  (f)ew details in PR or from company discussions make it difficult to have any increased clarity on '661's ultimate likelihood of success in other populations, though timelines for those other Phase IIIs appear intact.

 Vertex is still not disclosing the bar for this interim analysis, so it is difficult to know if any small signals activity were observed, though we believe if there were any lung function benefits worth following up on the study would likely have proceeded to part 2. 

Vertex traded down 3.2% after hours last night when the news was released, having ended the normal day s trading nearly 1% up.

The California-based Scintilla, which has been wholly owned by the biosimilar and oncology biotech Sorrento, is buying into Scintilla's lead program: a nonopiate epidural steroid injectable to treat chronic back pain that is slated to start Phase III trials next year.

This dovetails with Scintilla s own lead program resiniferatoxin (a.k.a. RTX), which is being tested in patients with intractable cancer pain, and is set for Phase II tests starting in 2017.

The merger deal sees Scintilla pay out $60 million upfront to Semnur s equity holders--which will be made up of $40 million in cash and $20 million in shares of common stock of Sorrento.

There will also be an extra cash boost worth up to $140 million from Scintilla to Semnur's equity holders, should its drug hit certain sales and development targets in the coming years.

This also comes after Scintilla penned a deal to acquire Malvern, PA-based SCILEX Pharmaceuticals just last week, whose lead product is for the chronic pain that can come with shingles.

When both deals are formally closed, Scintilla said it will then:  Operate as a standalone company focused on pain management,  with  key members  of Semnur s management team set to take a seat on Scintilla s existing executive table.

Dr. Henry Ji, president and CEO of Sorrento, said:  Upon completion of the pending acquisitions and integrations of Semnur and SCILEX, Scintilla will immediately become a truly unique pain management company with a multiple product pipeline and an experienced management team led by Jaisim Shah from Semnur and Anthony Mack from SCILEX. 

 The acquisition by Scintilla reflects the strength of Semnur's technology, IP and tremendous potential of our lead product candidate,  added Mahendra Shah, executive chairman of Semnur Pharmaceuticals, and MD of Vivo Capital.

 We are excited to join Scintilla and be a part of such a dynamic company that will be a major player in the pain management space.

The report, coming out from Kineticos--in partnership with Ipsos Healthcare and Demy-Colton--asked 51 biotech CEOs across small and large cap companies how healthy their sector felt in Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.

The answer sheet came back positive on the money side, with CEOs marking the  very confident  box when it came to raising capital in the public market, jumping from a lowly 18% marking the same box in Q1 to a healthier 39% three months later.

And 98% of CEOs said they are either  very confident  (53%) or  somewhat confident  (45%) in their companies and the overall industry.

While deal values and deal competition remained stable, those labeling the overall deal landscape as  good  declined for a third straight quarter (45% in Q1 to 35% in Q2).

When it comes to the regulatory side of things, confidence is slowly rising, although it could only really go up after only 22% of surveyed CEOs said back in Q1 that they were  very confident  in the regulatory environment. In the second quarter, this had edged up to 31%.

On top of this, 75% said they expect the frequency in FDA approvals over the next 18-month period to remain stable.

But when it comes to CEOs planning to partner externally, Q2 saw a decrease in confidence (70% to 65%)--although this remains significantly higher than those planning to market their meds on their own (just 12%).

What s the biggest threat to biotech s future? Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of chiefs asked said the largest risk to their business remains getting enough money in to keep going, and comes after several biotechs such as the Cambridge, MA-based cancer company Bind have filed for bankruptcy in the past quarter.

This concern was much higher than the risk of poor clinical results, which was the biggest concern for only 14%.

When asked about the Q2 results, Steve Girling, president of Ipsos Healthcare said:  After a year of surveying biotech CEOs who are leading development stage companies, we've found that early exuberance about the flow of available funds has been replaced by a broader confidence in the potential to bring new assets to market.

 The upcoming U.S. election is likely to have a material impact on the industry, so it will be fascinating to see whether, and how quickly this influences CEO confidence.

It raised $150 million, an impressive feat given that its market cap is just around $450 million. And it did a couple of deals a CAR-T development joint venture with 3SBio and a partnership with Servier to develop a preclinical anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

Now, Sorrento has brought on a former Celgene ($CELG) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jerome Zeldis as CMO and President of Clinical Development. He was with the biopharma for almost 20 years, most recently under the joint title of CEO of Celgene Global Health and CMO.

""Sorrento has an impressive portfolio of unique assets that I believe will clearly differentiate themselves in addressing unmet medical needs in a multitude of markets,  Zeldis said in a statement.  I greatly look forward to joining the team that is growing Sorrento into a leading biopharmaceutical company and using my experience to build a world-class clinical and regulatory organization for the efficient, high-quality clinical development of Sorrento's cutting-edge immunotherapies.""

At Celgene, he oversaw clinical trial development of Celgene molecules. He was the Associate Director of Clinical Research at Sandoz Research Institute and the Director of Medical Development at Janssen Pharmaceutical Research Institute prior to his position with Celgene.

Zeldis was already quite active amongst smaller biopharmas; he is the board chairman at Alliqua, Semorex, and Trek Therapeutics, as well as vice chairman at MetaStat. He also serves on the boards of Kalytera Therapeutics, BioSig Technologies, IR Biosciences Holdings, PTC Therapeutics, and Soligenix.

""His expertise and track record in highly successful drug development will be invaluable to progress the clinical development of our program pipeline towards FDA approval and commercialization,  said Sorrento President and CEO Dr. Henry Ji.

He continued,  Jerry's appointment highlights our focus on investing in clinical development and our steadfast commitment to Sorrento shareholders following the recent $150 million private placement led by Ally Bridge Group completed in June of this year.""

In May, Sorrento had been subject to criticism from activist investor Wildcat Capital Management for its prolific creations of subsidiaries and joint ventures which the investor was concerned is resulting in significant expenditures without offering returns.

Wall Street seemed pleased with the addition of Zeldis, sending Sorrento shares up 5% in early trading after the news.

Now, it s adding to an existing partnership with Bavarian Nordic to start a Phase II combo trial of Opdivo with Bavarian s cancer vaccine CV301 in previously treated NSCLC.

The pharma has said it is looking to combinations, in particular with another of its immunotherapies, Yervoy (ipilimumab), as a way forward on Opdivo in untreated NSCLC; the relatively low 5% rate of PD-L1 expression used in the trial, as opposed to that used in a similar study of competitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) from Merck ($MRK), was also widely criticized by industry observers.

Under the new clinical development collaboration with Bavarian Nordic, BMS will supply Opdivo for a Phase II clinical trial in combination with CV301 to treat previously treated NSCLC patients. The Bavarian candidate targets cancer antigens CEA and MUC1 and upregulates PD-L1. The companies hope that the combination, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, will offer greater benefit than Opdivo alone.

The trial is slated to enroll about 160 patients and will specifically be in patients with previously treated NSCLC--an indication for which Opdivo is already FDA-approved. Bavarian Nordic retains all rights to CV301, which was originally developed by the National Cancer Institute.

 While we have discussed the potential benefit of combining our cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors for some time, this is now within reach as we have once again been able to strike an agreement with the leading immune-oncology company in the world, this time to explore the potential synergy between our programs to benefit patients with lung cancer,  said Bavarian Nordic President and CEO Paul Chaplin in a statement.

He added,  We look forward to the initiation of this study later this year, 

The initial partnership between Bavarian and Bristol-Myers dates back to March 2015--and is worth up to $1 billion. It s specifically an option deal for the former s Prostvac, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeting cancer immunotherapy to treat prostate cancer.

At the time of the deal, Prostvac was already in an investigator-sponsored Phase II trial in combination with BMS s Yervoy. The partners planned to do one or more exploratory combination studies of Prostvac with BMS immuno-oncology agents.

The two companies will specifically combine both meds in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a form of kidney cancer, with Bristol-Myers supplying its blockbuster drug for use in the Phase I/II Aveo-sponsored TiNivo trial.

The early-stage test will be assessed with escalating doses of tivozanib with Opvido, and then be followed by an expansion Phase II cohort at an established combination dose.

The trial will be led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee.

This will be a much needed positive R&D update for the biotech, which has been beleaguered by problems from its VEGF inhibitor for years.

First up in its history, the FDA shot down its hoped-for approval in renal cell carcinoma, calling its pivotal data ""uninterpretable"" and leading the biotech to lay off more than half of its staff. Then, in December 2013, Astellas and Aveo further dashed hopes for the VEGF blocker by revealing that it was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint in a study on colorectal cancer.

Finally, in early 2014, the two shut down a Phase II study on tivozanib in breast cancer when it failed to enroll enough patients, which looked to have closed the book on the drug's last potential indication.

All of this saw Aveo, now known as Aveo Oncology, badly hit, losing Biogen ($BIIB) and then Astellas as research partners before falling into penny-stock territory and being forced to make a series of job cuts.

But the company is, doggedly, still seeking a reprieve for tivozanib, and in December its shares shot up by 27% after it announced a European licensing pact for the drug. It is also continuing with a trial of the drug as a monotherapy.

Remarkably, however, it got worse when the SEC handed down a $4 million penalty in March of this year. The fine came while seeking to ban three of its former execs from leading any company ever again after allegedly misleading investors on the safety of tivozanib.

The SEC, via a court in Boston, alleges that Aveo deliberately withheld the fact that the FDA had deep concerns about the drug in its public statements in 2012 and 2013, and failed to tell investors that the regulator wanted a second clinical trial to address concerns about the patient death rate during the first study.

The firm never did undertake that second trial and it was left to the FDA--which rejected the drug three years ago--to tell the public about its concerns, promptly sending the firm's stock price down by 31%.

Aveo raised $53 million in a public offering of its stock in January 2013--all while failing to disclose that the FDA staff had explicitly recommended a second study for tivozanib, according to the SEC.

BMS, too, has hit a recent R&D snag with its seemingly all-conquering Opdivo, which already has a license to treat advanced RCC patients in a second-line setting.

The drug was looking to bump itself up the pathway in non-small cell lung cancer, but this month flubbed a key late-stage trial, hampering its chances of a first-line setting in the disease. Both will hope to have better luck with their combined approach to kidney cancer.

 The introduction of immunotherapies has greatly improved outcomes in renal cell carcinoma, and combination therapy is the obvious next step in advancing treatment,  said Professor Escudier.

Dr. Michael Needle, chief medical officer of Aveo, added:  This study has the potential to unlock a more effective, better tolerated new treatment approach in RCC. We appreciate Bristol-Myers Squibb s support for this study, and we look forward to working with Dr. Escudier and his team to fully understand this potential. 

Aveo ended Q2 with $39.5 million in cash, according to its latest financials posted this month.

Canadian biotech Aurinia Pharmaceuticals ($AUPH) posted the topline results from its Phase IIb AURA-LV study this morning in a test that was focused on patients with active lupus nephritis (LN), a form of the disease known as lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has a number of subpopulations and complications from the broader condition.

Lupus kidney disease (a.k.a. lupus nephritis) is one of the most serious and potentially life-threatening complications of this autoimmune disease, affecting as many as 60% of people with lupus.

The biotech said that its trial hit the primary endpoint by showing statistically significantly greater complete remission of the disease in patients treated with voclosporin twice a day over 24 weeks of treatment.

The trial pitted voclosporin added to current standard-of-care therapy, namely Roche s ($RHHBY) organ rejection drug CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil), against placebo plus CellCept in achieving complete remission in 265 patients with active LN.

Data showed that 32.6% of patients in the low dose voclosporin arm, 27.3% in the high dose arm and 19.3% in the control arm achieved complete remission (CR), the study s primary endpoint. Patients treated with voclosporin were also twice as likely to achieve CR compared with placebo. But the market has not responded well to these data, with its shares down around 50% pre-market.

Analysts at Leerink said that the stock was trading down because there were 13 deaths across the study, with 10 in the low dose arm of the drug. The company said however that these deaths were due to the severe underlying nature of the disease, and not its drug.

 While this does naturally raise questions, it is important to be mindful that these lupus nephritis patients were extremely sick and treated at many sites with differing practice patterns in Asia, some of which we believe were in much less developed places,  Leerink said in a note to clients.

 The company noted that there were no clear underlying patterns among the deaths, and that one patient (who achieved complete remission) for example had baseline proteinurea of 29 grams, which was the highest value they have ever seen in their entire career of treating lupus patients. 

After talking with the biotech s exec team this morning, Leerink said that it was  incrementally more comfortable that the FDA will view the risk/benefit of voclosporin favorably. 

The firm added:  We believe that AUPH shares would not be trading down so precipitously (if at all) if this were made clearer [ ] All of the deaths occurred in much less developed places including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Russia, and no Americans died in the study. 

It also said on the efficacy side that at first glance, the effectiveness seen in the drug arms  looks lower than what we had expected, but is still respectable. 

The drug works as a calcineurin inhibitor and as an immunosuppressant. By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses.

 We are very pleased by these encouraging results and are grateful to those that participated in our clinical trials,  said Neil Solomons, Aurinia s CMO.

 The AURA study was conducted under rigorous and stringent criteria, enhancing our confidence in voclosporin s potential ability to provide a substantial improvement over the currently accepted standard of care, especially given that study participants had such active disease and were exposed to such a low corticosteroid load. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of improving long-term outcomes for these patients. 

Aurinia said in a statement that it now plans to meet with the FDA at the end of the year to:  Discuss these data and the drug s subsequent clinical development and path to registration in LN. 

There are still more data to be presented, however, and the study will continue through 48 weeks, with results set to be released early next year.

A number of companies are looking into lupus treatments, including Biogen s ($BIIB) anti-BDCA2 antibody that is currently in Phase I and UCB s dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand currently in early-stage trials that is expected to move into midstage by year s end. Biogen also recently snuck in a new lupus treatment, a Bruton s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor known as BIIB068, into the clinic earlier this year.

SLE is a difficult-to-treat disease with a number of variations and subpopulations of patients such as LN--but one littered with late-stage failures.

A few years ago, GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) became the first drugmaker in more than half a century to gain approval for a new treatment for the disease in the form of Benlysta (belimumab).

The drug, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets B-lymphocyte stimulator, has however struggled to make much of a sales impact for the company since its FDA approval in 2011.

Benlysta has a license for patients with active, autoantibody positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy--but brought home just  230 million ($338 million) in 2015. It has not, however, been approved for severe active lupus nephritis.

Other candidates are also in the mix for lupus, including UCB s epratuzumab--although this failed two Phase III trials last year after missing its primary endpoints. AstraZeneca ($AZN) also posted positive Phase II data for its SLE candidate anifrolumab last year. Eli Lilly ($LLY) had been testing its drug tabalumab for the condition, but this was axed in 2014 after it too failed several pivotal late-stage studies.

Anthera Pharmaceuticals  blisibimod, which focuses on anti-BAFF activity in LSE, is still going in mid- to late-stage studies. And in May, a new startup biotech called Thunderbolt was launched as the brainchild of Baxalta, the Mayo Clinic and Velocity Pharmaceutical Development, with a focus on SLE, also via an anti-BAFF mechanism.

The moves see the Roche ($RHHBY) spinout discard the antibiotic 11 months after revealing its interest in the program, and go after a new indication with its small molecule tumor checkpoint controller.

Basel, Switzerland-based Basilea went public with its inhaled antibiotic plans in September, at which time it committed  5.5 million ($6.1 million) to a consortium to hustle the drug toward the clinic. The drug, monosulfactam antibiotic BAL30072, was part of a 5-year Innovative Medicines Initiative that is funneling  50.7 million into the development of treatments for chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Novartis ($NVS) is also involved in the project.

Basilea, however, thinks its inhaled antibiotic is unlikely to make the grade, prompting it to put the program on the scrapheap before advancing as far as Phase I. BAL30072 was selected for the inhaled antibiotic project on the basis of in vitro and in vivo evidence of its activity against numerous multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but a full review of data generated to date has led it to conclude the drug is lacking overall.

The decision marks another blow for BAL30072. An intravenous form of the antibiotic has stuttered through early-stage development for years. Basilea first tested the antibiotic in humans in 2011, at which time it was aiming to have the drug in Phase II by 2013. That target came and went. Basilea landed an $89 million contract with BARDA in 2013, leading to the initiation of a Phase I combination study the following year. Elevated liver enzyme levels limited dosing in Phase I.

With Basilea scrapping the inhaled antibiotic project and the BARDA contract ending after the initial funding period, BAL30072 appears to have run out of new avenues to pursue. But, while a door has closed on the antibiotic, another has opened for Basilea s tumor checkpoint controller BAL101553. Having generated evidence the small molecule can penetrate brain tissue and act against tumors in the organ, Basilea is expanding its clinical development program to include glioblastoma.

The plan is to start adding patients with this form of brain cancer to an ongoing Phase I/IIa trial of an oral form of BAL101553 by the end of the year. To date, the study has enrolled patients with other types of solid tumors.

The topline data from Redwood City, Californian-based specialty pharma co AcelRx Pharmaceuticals ($ACRX) were posted from a small, single-arm, open-label Phase III trial of ARX-04 (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury.

The study--in part funded by the Department of Defense to assess how well this drug might help soldiers injured in the line of duty--saw the 76 patients treated with ARX-04 have an overall mean pain intensity difference to baseline (PID) of 2.9 from a baseline of 8.1, or 35%, on a 0 to 10 rating scale at 60 minutes after taking the med.

The small cap company has not in its statement, however, provided any primary endpoints, and the study itself is very small and not comparative, so a definitive takeaway is not easy to make.

There is also the deeper problem of measuring pain in this clinical setting. In the 2014 paper:  Clinical importance of changes in chronic pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale , authors writing in the Pain journal say that it is:  Difficult to interpret the clinical importance of changes from baseline on this scale (such as a 1- or 2-point change). To date, there are no data driven estimates for clinically important differences in pain intensity scales used for chronic pain studies. 

The drug itself, which is a powerful opioid stronger than morphine and its parent med fentanyl, is a higher dose version of the company s EU-approved Zalviso (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) for severe post-op pain. In Europe, the drug is marketed with Grunenthal.

Zalviso is in fact a hybrid of Sufent--a treatment which has been authorized in the Netherlands since 1978 as an anesthetic-analgesic. But Zalviso, which is a drug-device system, has had less luck in the U.S., and is currently producing new trials after receiving a complete response letter from the FDA back in 2014.

ARX-04, which is used under the tongue through a disposable, prefilled, single-dose applicator, saw its Phase III carried out in two cohorts.

Drilling down into these data, the first part assessed 40 patients using the experimental drug while the second extension phase enrolled 36 adults who could get up to four doses of ARX-04, given hourly as needed for pain.

Interim results posted back in February from the first cohort showed that patients treated with a single dose of ARX-04 experienced a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 2.7 at 60 minutes.

The latest data show that patients in the second cohort reported a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 3.1 on the 0 to 10 pain intensity scale, again after one hour.

Of these 36 patients, 7 received a second dose of ARX-04, and two received a third dose. For 75% of patients in the second cohort, a single dose of ARX04 was sufficient for pain relief and 8% of patients received morphine in addition to ARX-04.

 The Department of Defense, which has provided us with development funding for ARX-04, suggested that we conduct a cognitive impairment assessment to determine if ARX-04 causes cognitive deficiencies, which is an understandable concern when treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield,  explained Dr. Pamela Palmer, co-founder and chief medical officer of AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.

 In addition to putting combat units in danger, drug-induced cognitive effects can impede diagnosis and treatment in a civilian emergency room. If borne out, ARX-04 s onset of pain relief, sublingual dosage form and side effect profile could make it an attractive option for doctors considering opioid analgesic treatment in emergency rooms and field-based settings. 

The ARX-04 Phase III clinical program is made up of three studies in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain.

The first, SAP301, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in ambulatory abdominal surgery patients; the second is SAP302, an open-label trial in adult emergency room patients; and SAP303, an open-label trial in postoperative patients.

The company closed up 5% at the end of play on Friday, before these data were released. It currently has a market cap of just $177 million, nearly half the $382 million it had last March just before it announced the need for more trials for its Zalviso NDA resubmission to the FDA.

It hopes to press the reset button by refocusing on a Roche ($RHHBY) deal that could continue to offer infusions of cash.

But it s still keeping all its options open, considering a partnership, merger or divestiture of non-Roche-related assets. Simply distributing any Roche partnership payments to shareholders is also on the table if no transactions along those lines result.

The Cambridge, MA-based biotech disclosed the Roche partnership this June and stands to receive an upfront of $7.5 million. Then in July, it said it stands to receive a $22.5 million milestone payment from the pharma as the IND became effective for a Phase I study of the partnered ocular disease candidate EBI-031, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds interleukin-6 and inhibits IL-6 cytokine signaling.

All this will be considered at an upcoming Aug. 15 shareholder meeting, including a final ratification of the Roche partnership. Eleven shares gained more than 10% in early trading on Aug. 12 to hit a meager market cap of about $90 million.

 We look forward to closing our licensing deal with Roche, contingent upon the approval of our stockholders at our upcoming stockholder meeting,  said Eleven CEO Abbie Celniker in a statement.

The EBI-031 IND covers Phase I clinical trials in diabetic macular edema (DME) and uveitis. Roche can buy out rights to the drug at a couple of points in its development, paying $135 million after a Phase II trial start but before Phase III, or $265 million before a regulatory filing is accepted for review.

If Roche doesn t buy EBI-031 from Eleven but continues with the partnership instead, the biotech stands to receive a total of $262.5 million in milestone payments along the way including $20 million on a Phase II start, $30 million on a Phase III start, $25 million on a U.S. regulatory filing, and $40 million on a U.S. launch. Eleven also stands to get 7.5% to 15% on net sales of any products containing EBI-031, a rate that escalates annually over a four-year period.

Eleven was founded in 2010 by Flagship Ventures and Third Rock Ventures as an ambitious effort to engineer protein therapeutics to address a wide variety of disorders including inflammatory conditions and coagulation disorders. It raised $55 million in venture capital.

Six years later, Third Rock and Flagship are still the main shareholders in the company, even after a mediocre IPO in 2014 that raised $50 million. Third Rock held 24.2% at June 30, while Flagship held 16.8%.

The Californian biotech, formerly known as Arrowhead Research, said it had raised the cash through a series of investors, including that perennial life sciences Orbimed, as well as RA Capital Management, Perceptive Advisors, RTW Investments and others.

The company is working on developing gene silencing techniques, with a number of its RNAi assets bought from Novartis in a $35 million deal that saw it grab the rights to three preclinical candidates.

In 2011, it bought out Roche s ($RHHBY) RNAi platform as this tech moved out of Big Pharma and into smaller biotech.

Arrowhead has for some time been locked in a rivalry with fellow RNAi specialist Alnylam ($ALNY) to get their RNAi meds onto the market first.

It s been a long time coming given that gene silencing as a concept garnered the Nobel prize a decade ago, but has lingered on the fringe of commercialization ever since then.

But there is much promise here as analysts have forecast that RNA-based therapies could generate $1.2 billion in revenue by the decade s end.

Last year, Arrowhead also posted positive data for its hepatitis B virus candidate and is also currently working on treating the genetic disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

After ditching its blood cancer trials for PNT2258 back in June, it has now walked away entirely from its development. But the biotech is looking for a quick turnaround with a newly licensed drug.

This new treatment, a Cdc7 inhibitor known as PNT141, was licensed during the last quarter and the Canadian biotech said it would start early work on the candidate right away, which will focus on as-yet-undisclosed oncology targets.

This drug is a real lifeboat to the biotech, as just two months ago, ProNAi had to halt Phase II trials of its lead drug PNT2258 in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma given its  modest efficacy.  The drug s future was in the balance while the biotech assessed whether it should go forward in other indications.

Today, however, the Vancouver-based company has decided to cut and run, and refocus its efforts on its new experimental med.

In a statement released alongside its second quarter results, ProNAi said:  No further investment in PNT2258 or the underlying DNAi platform by ProNAi is contemplated and the company subsequently has closed its research facility based in Plymouth, Michigan, which supported these programs. 

Dr. Nick Glover, president and CEO of ProNAi Therapeutics, was keen to move on from its dropping of PNT2258 by talking about his new treatment.

 Our goal is to build a broad pipeline consisting primarily of assets that leverage discoveries on the leading edge of cancer biology,  he said in a statement.  PNT141 highlights this strategy as Cdc7 has a central function in both DNA replication and DNA damage response, two mechanisms that are increasingly recognized as having critical roles in driving cancer. In addition to toxicology and manufacturing work, we are conducting a robust preclinical assessment of PNT141 aimed at further informing our clinical development plans and patient selection strategies as we prepare this product candidate for clinical trials. 

As of June 30, 2016, ProNAi had $130.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $150.2 million at the end of last year.

The data suggest Zealand s pen achieves clinically relevant increases in plasma glucose in comparable times to GlucaGen, but, notably, its longer shelf life supports ready-to-use formulations.

Copenhagen, Denmark-based Zealand enrolled 81 Type 1 diabetics in the study and gave them single doses of ZP4207, its glucagon peptide analog, or Novo s GlucaGen following an insulin-induced hypoglycemic event. The trial assessed a variety of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic endpoints, such as time to peak plasma glucose concentration. From the limited, selected look at the data shared by Zealand in its release, ZP4207 held its own against GlucaGen.

The three highest doses of ZP4207 triggered blood glucose concentrations of 70 mg/dl or more in the 30 minutes following administration. GlucaGen also hit this target. ZP4207 matched up to GlucaGen in terms of the time it took to increase plasma glucose to 20 mg/dl, a level Zealand views as being clinically relevant. Taking the median of the dataset, the experimental therapy and GlucaGen both drove plasma levels up past 20 mg/dl in 9 to 10 minutes. Safety was similarly comparable.

That is all the information Zealand has released for now. Zealand intends to publish the full Phase II data in the future but, as it stands, is yet to share details of how ZP4207 performed against the majority of the 15 PK/PD outcome measures assessed in the trial, including all of those designated as primary in the protocol. Zealand SVP Hanne Leth Hillman told FierceBiotech how the outcomes came to be selected for inclusion in the top-line release.

""We have chosen to inform of the outcome on those of them that we consider to have main clinical relevance for the therapeutic potential of our analog in a hypoglycemia rescue setting, and save information on the outcome on all other parameters until we have analyzed the full Phase II data set and discussed them with the FDA,"" Hillman said.

Zealand, which has been upfront about negative data in the past, thinks the results add to evidence of the attractive profile of ZP4207. Armed with the data, Zealand now plans to talk to FDA to define how to take ZP4207 forward, a process it sees leading to Type 1 diabetics gaining access to a more convenient way to treat severe hypoglycemia.

 With the current results we believe to be one step closer to being able to offer insulin dependent diabetes patients a ready-to-use pen for convenient and fast rescue from severe hypoglycemia--or insulin shock,  Zealand Chief Development and Medical Officer Adam Steensberg said in a statement.  We see a clear need for a patient friendly rescue product and we look forward to the next step in development. 

The appeal of ZP4207, which is now also known as dasiglucagon, lies in its shelf life. GlucaGen is sold as a powder, a form that means it must be dissolved in an accompanying solvent prior to administration. By creating a glucagon peptide analog stable enough to be kept in a liquid solution, Zealand thinks it can provide diabetics with a rescue pen that is ready to use. The drug is also central to the artificial pancreas Zealand is working on with Beta Bionics.

Following the failure of its cardiac reperfusion injury drug in Phase II earlier this year, ZP4207 is the most advanced candidate in Zealand s in-house pipeline. The company is best known for its alliance with Sanofi ($SNY), in particular the GLP-1 peptide agonist Adlyxin.

HuTARG works as a protein engineering platform and is, according to ITS, the first fully mammalian tech that generates antibody diversity in vitro via RAG1/RAG2 mediated V(D)J recombination.

This, it says, helps it create  highly potent protein-based biologics.  Further explanation and therapy area targets were also not disclosed, although Zymeworks said its use of HuTARG would be  directed towards challenging disease targets. 

Ali Tehrani, president and CEO of Zymeworks, said:  We view the HuTARG platform as a leading technology for the discovery and generation of therapeutic antibodies. This further strengthens our in-house antibody discovery capabilities and accelerates the development of Zymeworks  novel bi-specific and multi-functional biologics and drug conjugates. 

Michael Gallo, president of Innovative Targeting Solutions, added:  Zymeworks is a leader in the development of innovative biotherapeutics. Together with our first-in-class protein engineering technology, they will be able to discover novel medicines that can transform the lives of people with grievous illnesses. 

Zymeworks has enjoyed 2016, having at the start of the year bagged a $61.5 million mezzanine round with an eye to following up with an IPO. It already has deals with the Big Pharma likes of Eli Lilly ($LLY) and Celgene ($CELG), as well as with Merck ($MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK).

In fact, back in April GSK doubled down on its existing deal with the Canadian biotech on a research deal that could be worth just shy of $1 billion, if everything goes well.

Most of Big Pharma s interest has revolved around its Azymetric bispecific drug platform. This bispecific approach doubles up on a drug s potential target, offering a complementary approach to its Efect platform, a library of antibody Fc modifications that can be used to orchestrate an immune response--either turning it up or tamping it down.

By adding the HuTARG platform to its arsenal, the biotech will hope to expand its attractiveness for further deals and complement its existing drug discovery IP.

The idea is to use the microbiome to help improve the efficacy of this major developing class of oncology drugs as well as, potentially, for standalone use to treat cancer.

The news comes after the PureTech Health-founded company raised $50 million earlier this summer to advance microbiome therapeutics into the clinic during the first half of next year to treat undisclosed infectious and autoimmune diseases.

The oncologists in the collaboration will be led by Dr. Jeffrey Weber, who is the deputy director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone.

 Dr. Weber is a pioneer in translational research, particularly in immunotherapy and the development of checkpoint inhibitors,  said Vedanta CSO Bruce Roberts in a statement.  We look forward to working with Dr. Weber to expand Vedanta s portfolio of immune activating microbial cocktails for use in standalone immunotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. 

This foray specifically to extend its reach into oncology comes just as microbiome therapeutics research has hit an early snag. Competitor Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) failed in a recent Phase II test of an oral microbiome therapeutic, SER-109, to reduce the risk of Clostridium difficile infection, a much more obviously microbiome-related indication.

The NYU deal specifically explores the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in cancer treatment. The expectation is that human gut bacteria can be used to create immunotherapies, based on work including a recent publication in the scientific journal Cell by Vedanta co-founder Dr. Kenya Honda.

 Checkpoint inhibitors are a major advance in cancer therapy, but many patients do not respond to therapy, and some patients who respond will eventually relapse,  said Weber in the statement.  Recent data suggest an important role for the microbiome in the anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy, and our other studies of the microbiome will offer interesting new clinical insights into how and why these treatments work.

The summer months have brought no respite to the British biotech sector. With Brexit still casting a long shadow over the industry, Neil Woodford unveiled a bad set of figures for his biotech-heavy fund and Motif Bio hit pause on its Nasdaq IPO plans. Gedeon Richter has some inkling of what the companies are going through. The Hungarian drug developer posted negative Phase III data on its Allergan-partnered depression drug, marking another setback in the turbulent history of the program. Genmab committed to a further escalation of its R&D spending, setting the company up to hustle a clutch of cancer programs into the clinic over the coming 18 months. And the Danish drugmaker then rounded out the week by unveiling a deal with Gilead. The Big Biotech will use Genmab s bispecific platform for a HIV program. And more. Nick Taylor

The net asset value of Neil Woodford s Patient Capital Trust fell 10.8% over the first 6 months of the year as Circassia s (LON:CIR) late-phase flop and the ongoing decline of Northwest Biotherapeutics ($NWBO) hit home. But Woodford is holding his nerve, trimming his position in relative safe havens such as AstraZeneca ($AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) to pump more money into early-stage firms.

Gilead ($GILD) has struck a deal to access bispecific antibody technology from Genmab (CPH:GEN). The agreement gives Gilead an exclusive license to use the Danish drugmaker s bispecific platform to create an HIV therapeutic, plus an option to take up another exclusive license on the technology.

Genmab (CPH:GEN) is looking to build on the success of its Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)-partnered drug Darzalex by upping its R&D spending. The plan is to increase operating expenses by 40% or more this year to position a CD3-CD20 bispecific antibody and a clutch of other early-stage programs to barrel into the clinic over the next 18 months.

4. Allergan and Richter push ahead despite PhIII fail for depression drug

Allergan ($AGN) and Gedeon Richter (BUX:RICHTER) have reported negative data from a Phase III trial of cariprazine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The data continue the turbulent history of cariprazine, which was originally rejected by the FDA in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder before later winning over the regulator.

Motif Bio (LON:MTFB) is the latest biotech to have its Nasdaq IPO hopes crushed by an unreceptive market. The late-phase antibiotic player aimed to secure $26 million ( 23 million) from new investors and $9 million from an existing backer, but this relatively modest ambition has proven to be beyond its reach.

The Princeton, NJ-based company posted a small but, for the biotech, significant update from a portion of its Phase II late-stage HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPVOPC) trial.

The biotech said it met its  stage 1 primary objective  and will now move on into the second stage of the clinical study. The study is assessing its lead immunotherapy candidate, axalimogene filolisbac (aka AXAL).

The biotech said in a statement that it chalked up this success after looking at both IFN-  and TNF  expressing T cells in the peripheral blood, and found that systemic HPV-reactive T-cell responses were increased in enough patients treated with AXAL to meet the stage 1 immune response target.

 The assessment of the TNF  and IFN-  response based on data from eight of the anticipated nine patients to be enrolled in stage 1 confirmed that the clinical study has already met the target for the overall rate of vaccine-induced T-cell response, paving the way for us to progress to stage 2,  said the study s lead investigator, Dr. Andrew Sikora of the Bobby R. Alford Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine.  Together with our prior published data showing increased intratumoral T-cell infiltration in a significant number of AXAL-treated patients, these data provide the confidence needed to move forward with the definitive evaluation of its immunogenicity. 

The next stage of the trial will enroll up to 13 patients with late-stage HPVOPC and will be run out of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with a second site expected to be set up at Baylor College of Medicine.

This test is being partly funded by a three-year, $1.1 million grant from the FDA s rare disease office.

This follows on from a deal with Amgen, signed earlier this month, worth potentially up to $540 million for its preclinical cancer immunotherapy candidate ADXS-NEO, which is intended to activate an individual patient s immune system to respond to unique mutations, or neoepitopes.

Advaxis has drawn fairly strong interest from Big Pharma, having teamed up with Merck ($MRK) and its PD-1 drug Keytruda in a 2014 no-money-down collaboration. That followed a separate pact with AstraZeneca ($AZN) on the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor MEDI4736 and preceded another tie-up with Incyte ($INCY).

But last year, the FDA placed a clinical hold on AXAL in a separate study in cervical cancer after the death of a patient, and also slammed the brakes on its HPVOPC study.

The hold was cleared two months later, lifting its shares after initially plummeting on the FDA hold news.

The biotech saw its shares up by more than 1.7% premarket trading this morning, with a market cap of $470 million.

The agreement gives Gilead an exclusive license to use the Danish drugmaker s bispecific platform to create an HIV therapeutic, plus an option to take up another exclusive license on the technology.

In return for the exclusive license, Gilead is paying $5 million ( 4.5 million) upfront and committing to up to $277 million in milestones. And, in the event the HIV drug makes it to market, Genmab will also pocket single-digit royalties. The agreement sets similar terms for Gilead s as-yet-unexercised option on a second exclusive license.

Gilead has entered into the commercial agreement a little more than two years after gaining access to Genmab s bispecific platform through a research collaboration. At the time, Genmab only referred to Gilead as an  undisclosed biotechnology company.  In the intervening period it has outed Gilead as the undisclosed biotech, and now it has gone a step further by revealing its plans for the platform.

By gaining access to a bispecific antibody platform, Gilead has strengthened its hand in a field of HIV research that is the subject of a growing body of scientific literature. Teams at NIH, The Rockefeller University and Duke University are among those active in the field. The Duke group has teamed up with MacroGenics ($MGNX), a Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)-partnered bispecific biotech, on its efforts.

The NIH and MacroGenics  research programs both involve bispecifics that bind to a HIV protein and the CD3 receptor. Hitting both these targets enables the bispecific to bring together killer T cells and HIV-infected cells and, in doing so, have the immune system attack reservoirs of the virus. The team at Rockefeller are pursuing a mechanism involving HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.

As it stands, neither Gilead or Genmab have disclosed which targets are covered by their agreement, but the former s interest in bispecifics shows the technology is being taken seriously in HIV. While the hepatitis C boom has defined Gilead in recent years, its HIV franchise generated sales of close to $10 billion last year. If the bispecific now in development at Gilead goes on to form part of that franchise, Genmab will add another revenue stream to its growing business.

The Copenhagen, Denmark-based biotech now lists J&J, Novartis ($NVS) and Novo Nordisk ($NVO) alongside Gilead on the list of top drugmakers that have licenses to use its bispecific antibody platform. In keeping with the Gilead agreement, the deals are heavily backloaded but have the potential to be tidy earners for Genmab.

Turning what are injectable meds for IBD diseases such as Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis into oral formulations is no easy task, as the digestive system is a very tricky route for oral peptides.

In the third question, Daniel and colleagues believe a mechanism needs to be in place for accountability to the data holder. They posit that private sector could develop an accreditation program and the system could be used to demonstrate compliance.

He lamented, ""As a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision.""

 Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward,"" Bertolini stated in a prepared statement.

The news comes as the nation's big insurers are rethinking their individual market strategies overall. Some, like UnitedHealth, are deciding to largely get out of the markets. Others, like Cigna, are trying to get into some exchange markets they see as being profitable, such as the Chicago market.

What's stunning about the reversal is that Aetna, as alluded to in Bertolini's statement, was a proponent for the ACA markets. Still, the realities of the still nascent market (sicker patients than expected, employers not off loading employee coverage to the market, insurers pricing plans too low, etc.) has forced insurers to draw up exit strategies or raise rates. Politico Pulse on Monday highlighted Charles Gaba's findings that the average rate request for insurers in the ACA exchange is 24%.

Recent CMS communiques have hinted at rules coming down the pipeline to help strengthen the market. This could see the light of reality in the form of changes to the risk adjustment program.

They have the option of being seen by a high-risk provider, or staying with their own obstetrician and getting consultation from high-risk providers.

These are just a few of the protocol changes UM and Jackson Memorial have put in place to deal with the growing public health threat of Zika, which has been linked to congenital birth defects such as hydrocephalus and microcephaly.

To date, the two hospitals have managed some part of the pregnancies of more than two dozen women who tested positive for Zika.

As of Aug. 10, there were 1,955 reported cases of travel-associated Zika infection in the U.S. and six locally acquired cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has recommended Zika testing for all pregnant women who have spent any time since June 15 in Wynwood and Midtown, a one-square-mile section of Miami where all of the local cases occurred.

 It s changing how women think about reproduction in this hemisphere,  says Curry, who has a background in infectious disease.  Certainly, in Miami, the last two weeks have accelerated the dialogue about getting pregnant and pregnancy risk in a way that no amount of media [coverage] would have done prior to local transmission. 

These days, Curry, who took the lead early on at UM in researching the emerging health crisis, serves an interdisciplinary emergency response team at both campuses, continually adapting and revising workflow and protocol so that they are up to date with CDC and World Health Organization guidelines, as well as compliant with Florida Department of Health requirements.

At UM, she also consults with patients who are interested in learning about how to get pregnant and avoid Zika infection, and how to manage pregnancy if they are already pregnant and positive for Zika. At Jackson Memorial, Curry devotes a half day a week in her obstetrics clinic to care for women who are either waiting for test results or want to have a conversation about how to proceed, based on those results.

Between the two campuses, she sees about 30 patients a day.

 We talk about what trimester they re in, about mosquito prevention   literally showing them the EPA website on repellents, talking about long sleeves, long pants, modifying their daily routines to avoid parts of the city or areas where there are lots of mosquitos or known transmission, then talking about standing water,  she tells Healthcare Dive. The conversations also cover use of condoms and the importance of ensuring that partners take steps to prevent mosquito bites or spread Zika infection.

Because Zika is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito and not person-to-person by coughing or sneezing, universal precautions instituted in all hospitals for infection control are sufficient for specimen handling and drawing blood. But that doesn t mean the virus doesn t impact the specimen workflow.

The UM computer system now recognizes orders that are unique to Zika and correlates that with the fact that these specimens are going to the health department, Curry says. This helps to manage workflow, keep track of specimens and make sure the documentation is there and health officials get what they need.

UM is also working to build into the computer system drop downs that will capture places of travel, mosquito bites and other patient information so that clinicians can check  yes  or  no  from the computer screen and have that data for documentation and future research, she says.

In labor and delivery, physicians and nurses are notified on a patient s arrival if she is Zika positive. The placentas, cord blood, and the neonatal specimens are all sent to the CDC.

 Logistically, keeping track of everything is a challenge,  Curry says.  All of that workflow had to be created in terms of the orders and order system, chain of command, making sure specimens are divided up and sent to the appropriate places. ","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Primary efforts will include working closely with physicians to streamline care and adhere to clinical guidelines, as well as developing high-performance post-acute networks to reduce readmissions, Bentley said. The analysis also pointed toward targeting device spending and care management for both surgical and medically managed patients, for which it broke down differences in spending.

  

 The models will be required in 98 randomly selected markets and are slated to be phased in beginning July 1, 2017. Comments on the proposed bundles are being taken through Oct. 3, 2016.

Some industry groups have suggested the cardiac care model poses a burden for safety-net hospitals and some others, such as those already subject to the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model. Also, as noted by Bloomberg BNA, when CMS announced the prosed CJR program it also announced the metro areas selected for participation, but when it announced the cardiac care model in July it did not specify the areas that would have to participate, making it impossible to prepare ahead of time.

The big pharma has previously said it will focus on combination therapies including Opdivo to further differentiate the drug. Since its FDA approval last summer, Opdivo has quickly outpaced Merck's rival PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), racking up sales and new indications. The failure in first-line NSCLC opens the door for Merck to regain an edge, having already said Keytruda beat out chemotherapy in treatment-naive patients.

Bristol-Myers will supply its already-marketed drug to Bavarian Nordic for the biotech to test with its own CV301, which targets two tumor-associated antigens, CEA and MUC-1. CV301 has been shown to upregulate PD-1, potentially eliciting a greater response in patients who would normally not respond to Opdivo.

The agreement with Bavarian Nordic does not require anything more of Bristol-Myers than drug supply and allows the biotech to retain all rights to its drug.

On the other hand, Aveo will lead a Phase I trial of tivozanib in combination with Opdivo in patients with renal cell carcinoma. A Phase 2 cohort will then follow at an established combination dose.

Aveo is hoping that tying its fate to the hot blockbuster could help transform its development of Tivozanib, which has had more than its share of failures over the years. Tivozanib was rejected by the Food and Drug Administraiton for renal cell carcinoma in mid-2013 with scathing criticisms from the agency regarding its clinical program.

The compound has also failed to show statistically significant improvements in other indications. There has been uproar from investors sending the stock into penny stock territory after evidence arose that executives were hiding safety concerns about the drug.","Healthcare"

Lupus nephritis is caused by systemic lupus erythematosus and, if untreated, can cause permanent and irreversible damage to tissues within the kidney, and possibly death. Aurinia acknowledged the overall rate of serious adverse events (including deaths) was higher in both treatment arms than in the control but noted ""the nature of the SAEs is consistent with highly active [lupus nephritis].""

Aurinia also said disease severity appeared greater in the low-dose voclosporin group, perhaps contributing to the higher number of deaths seem in those patients.

Nearly a third of patients on the low dose hit complete remission, compared to 27% on the high dose, and 19% on placebo. The results were statistically significant, but just barely.

Dosing of the oral corticosteroids was tapered over the course of the trial. Given the continued efficacy seen, voclosporin could allow for lower dose treatment with steroids, which have a number of side effects.

"ICPE Booth A2 - ICON"," Discover a convergence model driven by real-world intelligence and patient-centric innovation. ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/icpe-booth-a2-icon/424319/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:32:00 -0400","NA","ICPE Booth A2 - ICONAs payers escalate measures to contain costs, providers adjust to new models such as the Affordable Care Act, and patients assume more financial responsibilities for their care, manufacturers are being forced to generate more complex and comprehensive bodies of real world evidence (RWE) about drugs  effectiveness and value.

Given the industry s R&D productivity challenge and an overall risk-averse regulatory environment, maintaining a consistent focus on optimizing value across the product lifecycle has become critical to manufacturers  survival.

These dynamics represent an opportunity to develop a novel  best-in-class  operating model that not only responds to stakeholders  rising evidentiary demands, but also moves beyond traditional norms to transform R&D productivity.

With the proliferation of data and demands for more transparency, a critical focus must be how RWE can be utilized by all external stakeholders to inform decision-making in early development.

While the use of RWE is not novel, the industry can push the envelope of current business practices by being more proactive about bringing insights from a broader range of stakeholders into early clinical development. To do so, manufacturers need to take the lead to establish connectivity between the disciplines that analyze RWE, and, in particular, bridge the silos of clinical and commercial groups throughout the product lifecycle. Convergent teams can creatively and innovatively deliver value by mapping key decisions against RWE from electronic health records (EHRs), observational research, mHealth devices, data from patient communities, and emergent predictive big data initiatives. This strategy facilitates deeper payer and patient-centric insights into optimal target indications, opportunities to improve care management, product feature profiles that align to potentially non-obvious patient populations, and viable protocol designs or recruitment strategies.

The informed application of RWE to key decisions is an advance we call  Real World Intelligence.  A new  best-in-class  operating model must employ real world intelligence to demonstrate improved comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness to payers and rapidly innovate differentiated products. Two additional strategies support the feasibility of this new operating model: patient-centric innovation   which can deliver transformative gains in the operational efficiency of studies   and vigilance for emergent technologies   which are pivotal for generating real world intelligence and forging stronger connections with stakeholders.

We believe this new model, based on real world intelligence, patient-centric innovation, and emergent technologies will open a number of key opportunities.

The efficiency at which novel therapeutics reach patients in need can be improved through real world intelligence s application to triage R&D resources, augment potential regulatory approaches, enrich endpoint strategies, and proactively manage safety risks.

Post-marketing groups possess a trove of RWE on customers  behaviors, preferences, existing treatment pathways, and disease and economic burden that are today utilized only for more narrowly defined, post-approval purposes. Under the new model, RWE is interpreted for clinical teams to align product development with specific unmet patient needs and hidden value opportunities. Insights reach R&D that ordinarily take years; beta-blockers, for example, found expanded use to control hypertension only after retrospective analysis of four decades of their use in heart attack patients.

In more resource-constrained portfolios, real world intelligence also can inform continuous asset valuation and support more robust investment criteria. One biopharma reported that simulations based on RWE and early clinical efficacy signals confirmed that while a compound would be safe, efficacious, and viable at launch, other portfolio assets could generate greater returns on the same capital. Resources were thus redirected.

Regulatory strategies can be augmented, too. In a precedent-setting case last year, RWE of patient risk preferences influenced the FDA s approval of EnteroMedics  weight loss implant. After the device missed its weight loss endpoint in its pivotal trial, the FDA considered evidence that a subset of eligible patients were willing to accept the risks of the device in exchange for prolonged weight loss, thus supporting approval and a targeted label.

The utility of a study s endpoints can also be enriched to more clearly demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness. Some established endpoints, such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), do not reflect a treatment s benefits in terms that matter to patients. For example, a sedentary patient may value a therapeutic that simply improves his or her ability to move between rooms. This patient-relevant outcome may be more sensitively demonstrated by augmenting the 6MWT with a validated wearable activity tracker, making the endpoints more meaningful.

Safety is another major application for real world intelligence. Adverse outcomes in randomized clinical trials can be subject to reporting bias, misattribution, and divergent perspectives between patients and clinicians. Structured RWE collection of adverse outcomes from patients, cloud-connected devices, and PRO-enabled online communities can augment clinically-reported safety information, mitigate potential biases, and increase regulators  confidence in a drug s safety profile. Furthermore, cloud-connected devices can accelerate detection of adverse event signals and expedite emergency care for patients. For example, a study with congestive heart failure patients could benefit by using a web-enabled scale to detect rapid weight gain and alert clinicians.

An estimated two-thirds of drugs fail to meet revenue expectations in their first year. Arrival at regulatory approval with limited evidence of real-world cost effectiveness and a suboptimal prioritization of payer targets will delay market access, restrain early revenue potential, and concede control of a product s value story.

An R&D model enhanced by real world intelligence ensures momentum to market. Early insights, the nuances of a drug s value to relevant stakeholders, and the potential future scenarios that may influence stakeholders at launch can enable manufacturers to collect the appropriate evidence package at the right time and through the most efficient strategies. Furthermore, as formulary decision-making begins more than a year in advance, a strong a priori communication strategy is critical to success.

As payers, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies demand RWE at larger scales, an intensified focus on the patient will be required to adapt development programs efficiently.

Adopting the concept of a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) toolkit can empower manufacturers to approach rising evidentiary requirements with confidence. The HTA toolkit represents a global value dossier of all information needed through all phases of market access and submission, including existing evidence that can effectively and efficiently direct further research. The toolkit addresses scenarios that may impact RWE requirements, including: the evidence gaps that will exist for the fragmented array of payers who will gate access in each region, the possibility of being on or off a treatment pathway at launch, or the prospect of different outcomes in populations excluded from prior RCTs. A targeted RWE generation program, publication strategy, and KOL engagement plan developed from and incorporated within the HTA toolkit will determine future success.

The large size and global nature of the post marketing programs, often necessary to demonstrate cost effectiveness to diverse payors, often present severe recruitment challenges, particularly due to deviations from enrollment estimates reported by sites during feasibility. Accuracy can be significantly enhanced through a direct-to-patient strategy using EHRs. Live EHR data allows tabulation and verification of patients who match enrolment criteria and visit a site with sufficient frequency. An ICON pilot program with IBM Watson Clinical Trial Matching employs this approach and uses cognitive computing to parse physicians  notes. Furthermore, IBM Watson Clinical Trial Matching has the capability to alert physicians of all patients who may be eligible. CRO-owned site networks also enable EHR-driven feasibility analysis and structures to ensure accurate feasibility estimates.

Appreciation of patients as partners in clinical research, rather than as subjects to be acquired and studied, is driving an evolution in patient engagement.

At the most superficial level, communication strategies such as disseminating trial results with lay summaries can help to acknowledge and thank trial participants for their contributions to the advancement of medicine. Lay summaries can also support patients, caregivers, and communities who research health information online.

The partnership perspective also improves enrollment success   that is, to ensure enrollment of not just enough patients, but the right patients. Emerging electronic informed consent platforms not only mitigate errors in the consent process, but also allow delivery of educational material to patients that employs comprehension-enhancing video and multimedia educational tools. Some platforms enable patients to also view these materials outside of the clinical setting. With this additional time, patients can better prepare questions for their doctors and further examine a trial s visit-by-visit requirements.

During a trial, attrition risks can be ameliorated through mHealth technologies that reduce the impact of a trial on a patient s normal routine. Electronic clinical outcomes assessment instruments can enable patients to report outcomes without clinic visits, for broader collection of RWE that can be instantly leveraged for R&D. Asthma Health, an inspired mobile app for at-home data collection by the Icahn School of Medicine, not only tracks patients  health and treatment responses, but also encourages habitual use by alerting them to local asthma triggers.

A fundamental differentiator for best-in-class status will be continuous vigilance for new technologies that gate the relevancy, scale, and efficiency of RWE generation, utilization, and communication. No single organization can innovate the breadth of technologies required, from social media platforms for patient recruitment and informed consent to validated actigraphy wearables that independently monitor specific patient behaviors to big data analytics that consolidate and parse EMRs for enhanced recruitment or adaptive risk-based monitoring. Manufacturers and their partners will need to monitor and capitalize on innovations from external organizations, including companies not traditionally associated with drug development, such as Apple and IBM.

The changing commercialization environment is a call to action for the industry to rethink the traditional R&D approach. Industry, payers, and patients must partner together to operationalize real world evidence as intelligence to inform product innovation. For both emergent and established companies, the R&D path can be simplified and enhanced by strengthening the connections between independent R&D and medical affairs organizations. Ultimately, the industry must rethink how to accelerate products to the clinic and attune them to patients  most pressing needs.

"Endo ditches pursuit of abuse-deterrence for Opana"," The specialty pharmaceutical company has withdrawn its sNDA after discouraging discussions with regulators.&nbsp; ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/endo-ditches-pursuit-of-abuse-deterrence-for-opana/424469/","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 10:24:35 -0400","NA","Endo ditches pursuit of abuse-deterrence for OpanaEndo is pulling its sNDA with the FDA after discussions with the agency. While the company didn't disclose the comments from the FDA, it's likely that representatives said the application was not approvable with the data Endo currently has.

The specialty pharma intends to continue its epidemiological studies of abuse deterrence in hopes of filing the sNDA some time again in the future.

""We anticipate the generation of additional data and we will seek collaboration with FDA to appropriately advance Opana ER,"" said Sue Hall, Endo's CSO and global head of R&D and quality. ""We believe in the ability of Opana ER to continue making a difference in the lives of appropriate patients and remain committed to safely and effectively addressing the needs of the pain patient community. 

Opana ER is an opioid pain medication meant for patients with severe pain who need constant treatment. The drug brought in about $38 million during the second quarter and accounted for just under 15% of Endo's revenues.

Yet, the drug has been facing increased competition from generics. An abuse-deterrence claim would go a long way in distinguishing the drug from the slew of low-priced pain medications available.

Abuse-deterrence has become a hot button issue, however, as the number of people abusing prescription pain medications has increased dramatically. Opana ER was mired in controversy last year when it became apparent an outbreak of HIV was spread when recreational drug users were dissolving and injecting the drug.

When the version of the drug was approved in 2012, regulators warned that the coating on the pill which made it harder to crush also made the drug susceptible to abuse by injection.","Healthcare"

"Innovation in Quality Metrics","The FDA is collaborating with industry to develop a groundbreaking new set of state-of-quality metrics","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/innovation-in-quality-metrics/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 16:17:00 -0400","NA","Innovation in Quality MetricsIn the world of pharmaceutical production, it is universally understood that a robust pharmaceutical quality system provides key elements of assurance and oversight for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. It ensures that patients are provided with medications that are safe, effective, and reliably produced at a high level of quality. However, despite recent advances in the manufacturing sector, quality issues remain a frequent occurrence, and can result in recalls, withdrawals, or harm to patients. Quality issues have also been linked to the rise in critical drug shortages. 

Regulatory agencies currently assesses the risk profile of manufacturing sites based primarily on their compliance history, as seen in warning letters and field reports, in conjunction with records on product recalls and market-based quality problems. These are not necessarily the most informative measures, and by their nature, provide historical or lagging data or signal detection. More relevant data relating to the state-of-quality, provided in advance, would better inform the risk factors that might predict quality problems and future drug shortages.

FDA s approach to quality oversight has evolved in recent years, and the new Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ) has made it a priority to establish a sounder basis for ensuring that pharmaceutical products meet high quality standards throughout the product lifecycle

This FDA led Research Project initiates a program aimed at developing and implementing a set of standardized manufacturing quality metrics. The establishment and collection of these metrics should provide various stakeholders   from industry to regulators   with greater insight into the state-of-quality at a given manufacturing facility, and allow stakeholders to better anticipate and address quality issues while simultaneously reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE QUALITY METRICS INITIATIVE

Since early 2013, FDA has been working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop goals and objectives for a metrics program. In response, several industry stakeholder groups have worked with FDA to develop consensus around the goals, as well as identify potential metric sets, including developing recommendations for their implementation and interpretation. Through a series of extensive engagements between industry and FDA there has been an acknowledgement of the complexity of the problem at hand, which is to develop a recommeded set of metrics which are objective and meaningful, easy to capture yet normalized to account for factors such as process differences and technical complexity. Furthermore, it is required that those elements selected will promote acceptable behaviors and not lead to any unintended consquences or unwanted behaviors.

Key Research Questions to Address in the Selection of a Proposed Metrics Set:

1. What is the appropriate set of metrics to collect for establishing the state-of-quality at a manufacturing facility?

2. Will this set of metrics provide adequate information for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturing, such as sterile injectables, bio-pharmaceuticals?

3. How should these metrics be defined?

4. What is the optimal reporting process and what support will be necessary to facilitate timely and uniform reporting.

5. What are the potential unintended consequences which may arise with chosen metrics?

a. Such as measuring OOS rate may result in companies not reporting OOS results or changing their standards of identifying OOS results to minimize the numbers.

b. Review of complaint trending might lead firms to resolve problems superficially without getting to root cause.

6. How can the FDA prevent manipulation of data and its unintended consequences?

7. How does company culture impact the data collection and the metrics?

8. How does the underlying quality culture of a manufacturing facility influence quality performance and how does one correlate its impact through these metrics?

9. How can one represent a set of complex behavior and performance criteria via a set of simple metrics?

10. How can these set of metrics be linked to operating efficiency and performance of the plants? Plants are naturally focused towards improving their profitability and cost. Significant efforts such as six sigma, lean, right-first-time programs are underway across the industry and have deep rooted support in many pharmaceutical operations around the world. Can the reportable quality metrics be a natural offshoot of such improvement programs?

ROLE OF QUALITY METRICS IN RISK-BASED SURVEILLANCE

Quality metrics are widely used throughout the pharmaceutical industry to monitor quality control systems and processes, and many of the components that inform those metrics (e.g., data on process capability output or statistical process control) are already collected and maintained as part of cGMP compliance. Several measures of performance are already common throughout the industry. The challenege is that they are currently defined differently across manufacturers, and even between sites operated by the same manufacturer.

The proposed FDA Quality Metrics program is not the first of its kind; rather, it draws from the example of existing private sector quality improvement programs that collect voluntarily reported, standardized quality metrics from a large and varying array of manufacturing sites, which are then used by participating manufacturers to benchmark their performance against industry standards and their peers.

The collection and analysis of standardized quality metrics can serve several functions:

  At a basic level, metrics should provide a quantitative and objective measure of quality at the manufacturing site, and provide a window at a systems level, to the effectiveness of the oversight and control of operations at a given site.","Biotechnology"

"Key Elements to Consider When Packaging Parenteral Products","With a complete understanding of processes and test methods, sub-visible particles and bacterial endotoxins can be reduced to acceptable levels.","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/key-elements-to-consider-when-packaging-parenteral-products/","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 17:50:00 -0400","NA","Key Elements to Consider When Packaging Parenteral ProductsVials, ampules, syringes and rubber stoppers are just a few examples of primary packaging components that pharmaceutical drug manufacturers utilize to package their end products. When these components are utilized for injectable drug products, also known as parenteral drug products, they must undergo several discrete processes allowing them to meet or exceed standards developed by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) and enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The two critical processes are particulate cleaning and depyrogenation.

Particulate cleaning is a pre-sterilization process that reduces the amount of sub-visible particles that can be found in packaging components. The test methods and limits for sub-visible particles are outlined in USP chapter <788> titled  Particulate Matter in Injections.  Depyrogenation is a dry heat process that reduces the amount of bacterial endotoxins in packaging components. The test methods and limits for bacterial endotoxins are outlined in USP chapter <85> titled the  Bacterial Endotoxin Test. 

Particulate matter in injections can be defined as extraneous, mobile, undissolved particles, unintentionally present in the end product (3).  These contaminants can come from several sources such as the environment, packaging materials and formulation ingredients (5).  Particulate matter can be extremely harmful when introduced into the bloodstream and can cause several adverse reactions in the patient such as vein irritation, local tissue infarction, anaphylactic shock and even death. Therefore, the USP places limits on the amount of sub-visible particles that are allowed in injections. The USP s limits on particulate matter, harmonized with the European Pharmacopeia and Japanese Pharmacopeia, are outlined in USP Chapter 788  Particulate Matter in Injections.  The chapter contains two test methods for particulate matter which are the Light Obscuration Particle Count Test and the Microscopic Particle Count Test. These two methods are utilized to determine the amount of sub-visible particles in the final product of small-volume injections (SVI) and large-volume injections (LVI). The details of the limits outlined in 788 are found in Table 1: Current 788 Particle Limits.

In general, any semi-solid to solid material may be counted as a particle and may be considered hazardous upon identification (5). Examples of such particles are air, liquid, gel, singular solid, aggregate, agglomerate, drug solid, salt, polymorph, lubricant and plasticizer. Three common types of particulate matter are extrinsic, intrinsic and inherent, described in table 2. It is critical to fully understand the identification, origin and characterization of particulate matter so the final product meets or exceeds the allowable particle count test for USP 788.

When utilizing packaging components for parenteral drug products, it is critical to reduce particulate matter to acceptable levels through USP purified water and Water for Injections (WFI) rinses. A typical procedure is outlined below.

It is important to note that the cleaning must be done in a certified class 100/10 clean room with high-efficiency particulate HEPA filtering. HEPA are air filters that must satisfy specific standards of efficiency and remove 99.97% of particles that have a size larger than 0.3  m from the air that passes through.

Depyrogenation can be defined as the reduction of pyrogenic substances, including bacterial endotoxin, and is generally achieved by removal or inactivation (5). Specifically, bacterial endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides which are molecules found on the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.  Lipopolysaccharides are relatively large molecules that are thermally stable and insensitive to pH changes (7). Therefore, destroying these molecules tend to be quite difficult. However, it is critical to reduce these to acceptable amounts when packaging parenteral drug products due to their harsh effects when injected into the body.

There are several techniques in which depyrogenation can be achieved. The two most common depyrogenation techniques are dry heat via a depyrogenation oven that reaches temperatures as high as 250 C or through a series of rinse cycles that consists of washing and rinsing with USP purified water and water for injection (WFI). The selection of technique is dependent on the chemical characteristics that make up the packaging component. For example, most glass vials are made from borosilicate glass which has a softening point of roughly 820 C; therefore, introducing a packaging component made up of borosilicate glass to a depyrogenation oven at a temperature of 250 C would not cause any issues. On the other hand, a rubber stopper can degrade at temperatures much less than 250 C; therefore, a rubber stopper would be depyrogenated via a series of cycles of washing and rinsing with USP purified water and WFI. It is important to note that both techniques require a validated three-log reduction in endotoxins starting from a concentration of at least 1000 EU.

A depyrogenation tunnels usually consist of three chambers. The first chamber is the  inlet chamber  that emits HEPA filtered air. This laminar flow keeps the transfer of glassware clean and protects the product from the potential  hot air back flow  coming from the hot chamber. The second chamber is the  hot chamber  where the glassware goes through its depyrogenation cycle. The third chamber is the  cooling chamber  which cools the glassware to room temperature so it can be sent to a sterile environment with Class 100/Grade A/ISO 5 conditions.

"Medical News Today: Celiac disease: Season, region of birth linked with increased risk in children","Season and region of birth may be associated with an increased risk of celiac disease in children before the age of 15, study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312353.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Immune System / Vaccines","Celiac disease: Season, region of birth linked with increased risk in childrenCeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition whereby the immune system - the body's defense against infection - mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The immune system mistakes the substances found in gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. CD is not an allergy or intolerance to gluten.

Prevalence of CD is estimated at around 1 in 100 people worldwide and affects at least 3 million Americans. CD incidence is increasing globally, which suggests environmental factors may play a role in the cause of the disease.

The objective of the Swedish study was to explore the effects of season of birth on the risk of CD, and compare different areas and time periods to suggest environmental factors that may be associated with CD seasonality.

The research team accessed a long-term study of almost 2 million children up to the age of 15 who were born in Sweden between 1991-2009. A total of 6,569 of the children were diagnosed with CD from 47 pediatric departments across the country.

Fredinah Namatovu, senior research assistant at Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine Epidemiology and Global Health at Ume  University, and colleagues examined the association between CD diagnosis and season, region, and year of birth.

Results from the research, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, showed that the risk of CD diagnosis among children born in spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November) was 10 percent higher than children born in winter (December-February).

However, seasonal patterns differed by region. Children born in the south of Sweden, where there is intense sunlight in spring and summer, experienced the highest risk of CD, followed by central Sweden, with the lowest risk of CD seen among children born in the north of the country, where spring is colder, and the summer is shorter.

Children under the age of 2 years were more likely to develop CD if they were born in spring, and children 2-14.9 years had an increased risk of CD when born in summer and autumn compared with winter.

Birth year was analyzed in three groups to observe any differences in trends: 1991-1996 represented children born during the CD epidemic, 1997-2002 included children born immediately after the epidemic, and 2003-2009 births were after the CD epidemic had subsided.

Children born between 1991-1996 had an increased risk of CD if born during spring, those born in the 1997-2002 group had a higher risk of CD if born in summer and autumn. In the 2003-2009 group, CD risk was greater if born in the fall.

CD risk was higher in girls than boys, regardless of age across all seasons and birth years.

The authors say that while there have been several studies that look at the association between season of birth and CD in Sweden, this is the first Swedish study investigating CD risk while taking into account four seasons and geographical variations.

No firm conclusions can be drawn from the research regarding cause and effect, as the study is observational. Also, one of the limitations of the investigation is the lack of data on infections and vitamin D level, which could be potential influential factors in seasonality and, subsequently, CD risk.

Namatovu and team write: ""One hypothesis for increased CD risk and spring/summer birth is that, those infants are more likely to be weaned and introduced to gluten during autumn/winter, a time characterized by exposure to seasonal viral infections.""

While some studies suggest breast-feeding to be protective against CD through mechanisms such as regulating gut microbiota and, furthermore, its effect on the immune system, recent studies could not confirm breast-feeding's protective effect.

The researchers also suggest that development of CD could be triggered by viral infections that alter intestinal bacteria and increase the permeability of cells lining the gut.

Among Swedish physicians, it is well known that the yearly epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, and influenza start in southern Sweden and spread northward over a couple of months, which supports some of the associations observed, the authors add.

Another suggested mechanism for seasonal variation of CD risk is vitamin D deficiency due to differences in sunlight and UVB exposure. Low Vitamin D levels during childhood are a risk factor for immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes.

However, every child is recommended and offered government-funded vitamin D supplementation from 1 week to 2 years of age, to ensure adequate levels.

""A remaining possible link to sunlight and vitamin D is that pregnant women who give birth in spring have the lowest levels of vitamin D during late gestation when important programming and development of the fetal immune system takes place,"" they suggest.

""Whatever exposures are important in explaining seasonality, they have to work in a well-defined period, that is, during early life when the immune system is in an important developmental phase, otherwise there would be no seasonal pattern,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: Brain's empathy center identified","Empathy is a high level emotion that helps us navigate the complex social environment we live in. New research may have found its neural home.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312349.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Neurology / Neuroscience","Brain's empathy center identifiedHumans are complex animals living in a complex environment. Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, helping us navigate social challenges.

Sometimes we do things to benefit ourselves; other times, we decide to act in a way that benefits others.

Humans evolved to be social animals, and, in social groups, people who only look after themselves cannot thrive within the group. An individual needs to act in a way that allows them to survive, of course, but there also needs to be generosity.

Being generous involves an understanding of the other person's needs; this takes empathy - an ability to put one's self in another's shoes.

Showing empathy and acting upon it is an essential part of being human.

That being said, some individuals - those with psychopathy or other types of personality disorders - do not have this hardwired ability and desire to help others.

Recently, researchers from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom decided to add to the current understanding of so-called prosocial behaviors and investigate the neurological origin of empathy and generosity.

Dr. Patricia Lockwood published her work this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To study this human trait, the researchers scanned participants using an MRI machine while they carried out tasks. The specific tasks were based on well-used models that test how people learn to benefit themselves. Participants had to work out which symbols they needed to press to bring themselves the biggest reward.

As a twist to the classic experiment, the participants also had to learn which symbols were more likely to give someone else a reward.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the results showed that people learned to benefit themselves quicker than they learned to help others. Additionally, using the MRI scanner, the team pinpointed the region of the brain that was activated when carrying out actions that helped other people.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area of the brain known to be involved in the control of a number of automatic processes, such as the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. It is also thought to be important in higher level functions, including reward anticipation, impulse control, decision-making, and emotion.

When the participants were learning how to help others, a specific part of the ACC was activated called the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC); this region was the only area to light up on brain scans, and it was not triggered while learning actions which favored the individual.

This implies that the sgACC is particularly tuned to controlling and monitoring generosity.

Interestingly, the team also found that the sgACC was not equally active in each of the scanned brains. Those who self-reported higher levels of empathy had higher activation levels, whereas individuals who did not activate it so readily, rated themselves as less empathic.

Although previous studies have highlighted certain, overlapping areas of the brain involved in empathy and prosocial behavior, this study adds a new level of specificity.

These findings are interesting in their own right, but they also hold potential for future psychiatric interventions. Because certain mental disorders involve a loss or lack of empathy, knowing which regions of the brain are likely affected could help in the design of more targeted drugs further down the line.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHA","A scientific statement from the American Heart Association says physical activity does not counteract the health risks linked to sedentary behavior.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312356.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Sports Medicine / Fitness","Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHAIn recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies documenting the harms of sedentary behavior - defined as any waking activity that involves sitting or lying down, such as watching TV or working on the computer.

Research has repeatedly linked sedentary behavior with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and more.

A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine earlier this year estimated that prolonged sitting is responsible for 430,000 all-cause deaths over 54 countries, and a more recent study claimed that sedentary behavior is a leading risk factor for mortality, second only to smoking.

While some studies suggest that physical activity can offset the harms of the prolonged sitting, other research claims that is not the case.

The new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) - published in the journal Circulation - supports the latter, finding that no matter how much exercise one does, sitting too much is detrimental to health.

Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D., chair of the AHA statement and director of behavioral research at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and colleagues reached their findings after conducting a review of the current evidence on sedentary behavior.

Highlighting the fact that Americans spend too long sitting, the review revealed that younger adults in the United States are sedentary for around 6-8 hours a day, while adults aged 60 and older spend around 8.6-9.6 hours a day sedentary.

The authors explain that sedentary behaviors normally have an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less. Slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, while vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.

Based on current evidence, Young and colleagues found that spending too much time sitting may raise the risk of impaired insulin sensitivity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death.

What is more, the review revealed that these risks are not reduced by moderate to vigorous physical activity, suggesting that prolonged sitting is harmful to health, regardless of how much one exercises.

Young says that, at present, they are unable to pinpoint exactly how long is too long when it comes to sitting, but for now, their advice is to reduce the amount of time spent sedentary and increase the amount of time spent active.

""There's a lot of research that we need to do. This statement is important because it starts the ball rolling and suggests sedentary behavior may play an important role in heart health and more. But, it's too early to make conclusive recommendations other than to encourage Americans to 'sit less, move more.'""

In line with the AHA's physical activity guidelines, the authors recommend engaging in around 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; they note that exercising in smaller amounts each day is more beneficial than trying to fit in the same amount of exercise in fewer days.

"Medical News Today: Flu nasal spray just as effective as flu shot","Contrary to previous studies, new research shows that immunizing children with the flu nasal spray provides similar protection to the standard flu shot.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312326.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Flu / Cold / SARS","Flu nasal spray just as effective as flu shotFlu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, and it can sometimes lead to death.

The most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccination, while everyday preventative actions - such as covering coughs and sneezes and frequent hand-washing - can slow the spread of germs that cause flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a yearly flu vaccine by the end of October for everyone over the age of 6 months. Vaccinating against flu can reduce flu illnesses, prevent flu-related hospitalizations, and protect people both individually and communally from becoming infected, known as herd immunity.

Current estimates reveal that the percentage of people who received an influenza vaccination during the past 12 months include 49.9 percent of children aged 6 months to 17 years, 31.2 percent of adults 18-49 years, 45.5 percent of adults 50-64 years, and 70 percent of adults 65 years and over.

There are several types of available flu vaccine options, such as the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), which are both injected forms, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the ""nasal spray"" flu vaccine.

Recent observational studies have shown that the flu nasal spray is ineffective, which has led to the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommending that the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.

The results of that research showed that in the last flu season from 2015-2016, the nasal flu vaccine had no protective benefit for children ages 2-17. In comparison, the children that received the flu shot were 63 percent less likely to catch the flu than those people who were not vaccinated.

However, new research published in Annals of Internal Medicine found that immunizing children with the live attenuated influenza vaccine - the type found in the flu nasal spray - did not provide better direct or community protection against flu than the inactivated influenza vaccine, or standard flu shot. The protection was similar in both groups.

Previous studies conducted in young children suggest that the nasal spray vaccine provides better direct flu protection than the standard flu shot, which would also suggest better herd immunity. However, most comparative flu vaccine studies assess direct protection only and do not consider community protection.

Lead study author Dr. Mark Loeb, of McMaster University in Canada, and colleagues conducted the research in the Hutterite community - a colony where individuals live communally and are isolated from cities and towns. The team aimed to identify if vaccinating children and adolescents with the flu nasal spray would provide better direct and community protection than the standard flu shot.

Amongst 52 Hutterite colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, 1,186 children were assigned to receive the nasal spray vaccine and 3,425 to receive the standard flu shot.

The team found that the nasal spray vaccine offered similar direct protection to children and in creating herd immunity as the standard flu shot. Dr. Loeb notes that while the findings do not show the superiority of the nasal spray vaccine over the standard flu shot, what they do show is that both vaccines had a similar effect, which differs from the ACIP data.

The new recommendation against using the flu nasal spray is for the upcoming 2016-2017 flu season. However, the CDC review new data to maintain or change recommendations on a yearly basis.

"Medical News Today: Will you age well? It might depend on your parents' lifespan","Offspring of parents who have a long lifespan are less likely to develop diseases such as heart disease and cancer in older age, a new study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312328.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Seniors / Aging","Will you age well? It might depend on your parents' lifespanLead author Dr. Janice , of the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, and colleagues publish their results in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

According to the Administration on Aging, in 2014, there were 46.2 million people in the United States aged 65 and older. By 2060, this number is expected to more than double, to around 98 million.

With an aging population comes a greater prevalence of age-related diseases, unless more strategies are identified to reduce the likelihood of such conditions.

While lifestyle factors - such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking - are known risk factors for poor health in older age, the research from Dr. and colleagues has focused on how factors inherited from parents may impact healthy aging.

Earlier this year, the team published a study in the journal Aging that found that the offspring of parents who live longer are more likely to possess genes that protect against a number of health conditions, including high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), and type 1 diabetes.

The new study builds on those findings, establishing a link between parents' lifespan and disease incidence among offspring.

To reach their findings, the team analyzed the data of around 186,000 adults aged 55-73, following them for up to 8 years.

Participants self-reported the lifespan of their parents, and subjects' incidence of certain diseases - such as heart disease and cancer - and death from these diseases were monitored.

Compared with adults whose parents had a shorter lifespan, those whose parents lived longer were less likely to develop a number of cardiovascular-related conditions, including heart disease, heart failure, stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation - abnormal heart rhythm.

In detail, the team found that for every 10 years at least one parent lived after the age of 70, the risk of death from heart disease among offspring was reduced by 20 percent.

Furthermore, sons and daughters of parents who had a longer lifespan were also less likely to develop cancer; each longer-lived parent was associated with a 7 percent lower cancer risk for offspring.

These findings remained relevant after accounting for a number of potentially confounding factors, including smoking, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and obesity, the team reports.

""To our knowledge, this is the largest study to show that the longer your parents live, the more likely you are to remain healthy in your 60s and 70s. Asking about parents' longevity could help us predict our likelihood of aging well and developing conditions such as heart disease, in order to identify patients at higher or lower risk in time to treat them appropriately.""

Study co-author Prof. George Kuchel, of the Center on Aging at the University of Connecticut, notes that aging is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, and the team's findings highlight the important role our parents play in the development of such conditions.

""As we understand these parental factors better, we should be able to help more people to age well,"" he adds.

"Medical News Today: What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?","Learn all about BUN levels, how they are measured, and when a BUN test might be used. This article also looks at ways to keep BUN levels healthy.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312337.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Urology / Nephrology","What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?A BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen test, measures the level of urea nitrogen in the blood using a standard blood sample. Urea nitrogen is the natural byproduct of the breakdown of protein.

According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, BUN tests are mainly used to assess kidney health. However, altered BUN counts can be the result of almost any disease, drug, or condition that affects the kidneys or liver.

As such, the test may be requested as part of routine checkups. BUN tests are also included in common blood tests, such as metabolic panels.

Medical professionals use BUN tests for a number of reasons, mostly to check or monitor kidney and liver function.

As the waste product of protein digestion, the liver and kidneys influence blood urea nitrogen levels heavily.

Urea is released by the liver into the blood and sent to the kidneys to be removed in the urine. Nitrogen is found in urea and is also the compound responsible for helping clear excess nitrogen from the body. For this reason, ""urea"" and ""urea nitrogen"" are often used to mean the same thing.

A component of many other blood tests, BUN tests may be ordered for just about anyone at any time. They require only a blood sample. A BUN test may also be done alongside other kidney tests, such as the creatine test.

BUN tests are usually ordered in cases of suspected kidney or liver disease. Though common in adults, signs of these diseases are easily overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10 percent of adults in the United States have long-term kidney disease. Many people are unaware that they have the condition.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explain that a range of medications can impact BUN levels, or how the kidney and liver work. Over-the-counter painkillers, in particular NSAIDS or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can all affect the kidneys. This class of drugs includes ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.

Natural diuretics, such as caffeine, and steroid use can also affect the kidneys. Antibiotics can also impact BUN levels.

There are many prescription drugs that can affect the kidneys, resulting in abnormal BUN levels, including:

According to the National Kidney Foundation, dietary supplements can also have a negative effect on the kidneys and alter BUN levels.

Generally, natural health products are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the effective dosage, source, and even the precise mixture of the supplement is questionable.

This lack of regulation also means herbal supplements may contain kidney-damaging compounds like heavy metals or chemicals like aristolochic acid.

People with kidney or liver disease are normally advised to avoid natural supplement. They are also advised to limit or monitor phosphorous and potassium intake.

Preparing for a BUN test is relatively simple. Those undergoing the test are advised to eat and drink as normal before the test. This helps ensure that results are more of a reflection of long-term levels.

Bringing a list of current medications and supplements on the day of the test can be helpful.

To perform the BUN test, a medical professional will draw blood from a vein. They will often use a vein on the inside of the elbow or outside of the hand. Technicians will then examine the blood sample.

After the sample has been drawn and the proper waiting period has passed, most people immediately return to their usual routine. The results will be sent to the requesting physician.

If the puncture site becomes painful, inflamed, or weeps pus or blood, the patient should seek medical attention. After the test, some patients may also feel faint, hungry, or dehydrated.

A rise or fall in blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate a wide range of health problems. This is because the kidneys and liver are involved in a wide range of body functions.

According to the Medical Council of Canada, normal blood urea nitrogen levels range between 7 and 22 milligrams per deciliter. A result higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter is likely to signal an underlying health problem.

Changes in BUN levels also occur with age and gender, among individuals, and during pregnancy.

Typically, BUN levels increase with age. BUN counts in toddlers are just 66 percent of those in an average healthy adult, and rates in those over 60 are just higher than in young adults.

BUN tests can also help determine the effectiveness of kidney treatments like dialysis.

BUN tests alone are not enough to diagnose any condition.

If BUN results come back as abnormal, medical professionals will usually follow up with other tests. A creatinine test and renal panel can help indicate kidney and liver health. Testing may be done to determine specific substance levels as well, like potassium, sodium, and calcium. Urine tests may also be ordered.

In some instances, physicians may also follow up abnormal BUN results by requesting tests to evaluate the blood creatinine to BUN ratio. The ratio of BUN to creatinine is usually between 10:1 and 20:1.

The course of treatment for each person with abnormal BUN levels varies depending on the cause and severity of the case. Those with organ failure often need intensive treatment, and dialysis may be necessary. Lesser BUN problems may simply require long-term monitoring.

In the case of abnormal BUN levels brought about by eating too much protein, people can limit eating food rich in protein, like meat, fish, beans, and dairy, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Staying hydrated also helps prevent the buildup of BUN.

BUN levels have also been tied to high blood pressure and conditions that cause restricted blood flow such as diabetes. As stress can greatly impact blood pressure, exercising, seeking counseling, and reducing stress levels may help steady BUN levels. Controlling blood sugar levels can also promote healthy BUN levels.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?","A study suggests that acetaminophen use, generally considered safe during pregnancy, may lead to a higher rate of behavioral issues in children.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312327.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Pregnancy / Obstetrics","Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?Acetaminophen - also known as paracetamol - features in a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, including actifed, panadol, and Tylenol. Prescription medicines that contain it include oxycodone and tramadol.

Apart from pain and fever, it is also included in treatments for allergy, cough, colds, flu, and sleep problems.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend a maximum dose of 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period, because overuse can lead to serious liver problems. However, as it is often combined with other ingredients, patients may not realize how much they are taking.

Previous research in animals has suggested that acetaminophen use during gestation can lead to neurodevelopmental problems, possibly due to a disruption in the endocrine function - the body system that regulates the hormones.

Studies of children in Denmark and New Zealand have revealed higher levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-type symptoms in those whose mothers used the drug during pregnancy. The FDA have expressed concerns about the use of acetaminophen and other OTC pain relief drugs during pregnancy.

Researchers led by Evie Stergiakouli, from Bristol University in the United Kingdom, studied data for 7,796 mothers who took part in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children from 1991-1992, along with their children and partners.

The team studied associations between behavioral problems in children and the use of acetaminophen by their mothers before and after giving birth. They also examined acetaminophen use by the women's partners.

They distributed questionnaires to assess the use of acetaminophen at weeks 18 and 32 of pregnancy, and when the children were 5 years old.

When the children were 7 years old, their mothers completed questionnaires about their behavior.

At 18 weeks of pregnancy, 4,415 mothers, or 53 percent, said they used acetaminophen. At 32 weeks, 3,381 mothers, or 42 percent, reported using it. The most common reasons for use were headaches, musculoskeletal problems, and infections during pregnancy.

After giving birth, 6,916 mothers, or 89 percent, and 3,454 partners, or 84 percent, used acetaminophen.

Behavioral problems were reported in 5 percent of children.

The findings indicate that children born to women who used of acetaminophen at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have behavioral problems and to be hyperactive. Those whose mothers used acetaminophen at 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have emotional and other challenges.

The use of acetaminophen by mothers and partners after the child was born was not linked with any behavioral problems, and the team did not find a link between maternal ADHD and the behavioral problems of the children in the study.

This, say the authors, suggests that the behavioral issues are not due to other, unmeasured social or behavior factors related to acetaminophen use.

A limitation of the study is that it does not reveal how much acetaminophen was used or for how long, but the authors believe that there is a link, and that something happens in the womb to cause this reaction. They call for more studies to confirm the results, to find out exactly what happens, or to see if there is another reason.

They also warn, however, that ""the risk of not treating fever or pain during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against any potential harm of acetaminophen to the offspring.""

A new analysis of old data shows that easy dietary changes may keep it at bay.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312314.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Gout","Gout flare-ups could be managed by blood pressure dietGout is a rheumatic condition caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints, known as hyperuricemia.

It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. Gout normally strikes in the base joint of the big toe and can be debilitatingly painful.

Flare-ups can last for days or even weeks, causing an individual significant discomfort.

Although the exact mechanisms that lead to a gout event are not fully understood, some risk factors are known; these include alcohol intake, hypertension (high blood pressure), insulin resistance, and a diet rich in red meat and seafood.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007-2008, 3.9 percent of all American adults and 5.9 percent of men (6.1 million individuals) had gout.

They also report that overall incidence of gout has risen 1.2 percent over the previous 20 years.

Although the dietary factors mentioned above are known to play a role in elevating levels of uric acid in the blood, the exact causes remain a mystery. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MD, recently set out to investigate the influence of diet on gout in more detail.

Dr. Stephen P. Juraschek and his colleagues reopened data from a clinical trial carried out in 1997 called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). The landmark study demonstrated that the DASH diet - reduction in salt, an increase in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and less red meat, sweets, and saturated fats - significantly improved blood pressure and cholesterol.

In the DASH-Sodium experiment, more than 400 participants were given either a DASH diet or a typical American diet for 3 months. Each month, participants were given differing amounts of sodium - 1.2 grams (low), 2.3 grams (medium), or 3.4 grams (high). The higher figure equates to a standard American diet.

Before the trial began and after each month, the researchers analyzed the participants' blood for various chemical markers; these included uric acid.

Dr. Juraschek and his team recently reopened the data set and analyzed the effects of each of the salt interventions on uric acid concentration.

Overall, the DASH diet led to a uric acid decrease of 0.35 milligrams per deciliter. Although that is only a moderate decrease, the team found that the change was greater for individuals who had the highest levels of uric acid at baseline. Participants with a reading of 7 milligrams per deciliter at the start of the study showed a reduction of 1.3 milligrams per deciliter.

To put that figure into perspective, drugs designed to treat gout, such as allopurinol, generally lower uric acid levels by 2 milligrams per deciliter.

When the team examined the interaction between sodium levels and uric acid, the findings surprised them - they were the opposite to expectations. During the low salt phase of the DASH diet, uric acid levels were at their highest; during the medium and high sodium diets, levels were reduced.

These changes due to salt intake were small but significant.

The authors, however, do not recommend that people with gout start adding salt to their diet. ""More than 70 percent of people with gout have high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Juraschek. ""If one was to consume more sodium to improve uric acid, it could worsen blood pressure.""

The results of the analysis are published this week in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology. Although further studies will be necessary to confirm the findings, the researchers are optimistic. If the DASH diet can prevent or at least minimize gout flare-ups, it would be of substantial benefit for gout sufferers.

Gout currently costs the healthcare system of America around $7.7 billion. A dietary change that controls gout while simultaneously controlling hypertension and cholesterol levels could make a significant difference to millions of lives.

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is considered a key contributor to the obesity epidemic; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than half of the U.S. population drinks sugary beverages on any given day, with consumption highest among teenagers and young adults.

When you consider that a single 12-ounce can of cola contains more than 9 teaspoons of sugar and around 136 calories, it is not hard to see how sugary drinks can play havoc with health.

For their study, Duffey and colleagues set out to investigate how switching an 8-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage with an 8-ounce serving of water impacts calorie intake and overall health.

The researchers analyzed data from the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), which involved more than 19,000 American adults aged 19 and older.

Specifically, they looked at how swapping sugary drinks for water affected participants' calorie intake, Healthy Beverage Index (HBI) scores - a system developed by Virginia Tech researchers to assess how certain beverages affect health - and obesity prevalence.

The team found that adults who swapped a single 8-ounce sugary drink - including soda, energy drinks, and sugar-sweetened coffee - for an 8-ounce serving of water reduced their total percentage of calories from drinks from 17 percent to 11 percent.

""Even those who consumed more sugary drinks per day could still benefit from water replacement, dropping the amount of calories coming from beverages to less than 25 percent of their daily caloric intake,"" notes Duffey.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that no more than 10 percent of daily calories should come from added sugar; the team believes swapping a single sugary drink for water could bring us much closer to this target.

The team also found that swapping a sugary drink for water led to a 9-21 percent improvement in HBI scores; higher scores were associated with reduced cholesterol and blood pressure levels. In men, higher HBI scores were also linked to reduced risk of high blood pressure.

Furthermore, the researchers estimated that switching from sugary drinks to water could reduce the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. by 33.5-34.9 percent, while increasing the prevalence of healthy weight by 29.7 percent.

Overall, the authors say their findings provide further evidence that switching from sugar-sweetened drinks to water can reduce calorie intake, which may reduce rates of obesity and its related conditions.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: 9 Diabetes Superfoods and How to Prepare Them","Learn all about nine different superfoods for people with diabetes. This article looks at walnuts, Ezekiel bread, and chia seeds among others.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312313.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 06:00:00 PDT","Diabetes","9 Diabetes Superfoods and How to Prepare ThemDiabetes is a disease causes elevated blood sugar levels due to a lack of insulin, the body's inability to use insulin, or both.

Poorly managed diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels and nerve cells, which may lead to foot problems and a condition called neuropathy. High blood sugar levels can also cause damage to the eyes and kidneys, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

People with diabetes should first make sure that they have a regular eating routine. Having a source of fiber, slow-digesting carbohydrate, lean protein, and healthy fat with each meal helps to control blood sugar levels throughout the day.

People should limit quick-digesting carbohydrates like white bread and pasta. Instead, they should opt for slower-digesting carbohydrates with extra nutrients like vegetables, whole grains, beans, and berries. These cause a smaller spike in blood sugar.

Here are nine examples of foods that can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet for people with diabetes.

The combination of fiber, protein, and healthy fats in walnuts makes them a great alternative to simple carbohydrate snacks like chips or crackers.

The fatty acids in walnuts can increase good cholesterol while decreasing harmful cholesterol. This may reduce the risk of heart disease or heart attack. People with diabetes are at a greater risk for these conditions.

People whose diets include large amounts of nuts put on less weight than those that do not, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Weight loss can help to reduce blood sugars.

The avocado is the only fruit that is a good source of healthy fat. Avocados also provide about 20 different vitamins and minerals and are especially high in potassium, vitamins C, E, and K, lutein, and beta-carotene.

Eating foods that contain healthy fats may help increase fullness. Eating fat slows the digestion of carbohydrates, which helps to keep blood sugar levels more stable.

Avocado is high in fiber too, with half a fruit containing 6-7 grams. According to the Department of Internal Medicine and Nutritional Sciences Program of the University of Kentucky, high fiber intake is associated with a significantly lower risk for diabetes.

Eating high-fiber foods can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, improve weight loss, and make insulin more efficient.

Ezekiel bread and other sprouted grain breads are less processed than standard white and whole wheat bread. The grains in Ezekiel bread are soaked and sprouted, allowing for higher protein and nutrient content. Bread made from sprouted grains tends to contain more B vitamins, fiber, folate, and vitamin C than other breads.

Ezekiel bread is often found in the freezer section. Sprouted grain breads have a denser consistency and are best when toasted.

Pumpkin seeds are high in magnesium. The body needs magnesium for over 300 processes, including breaking down food for energy.

A lack of magnesium is linked to insulin resistance, a main cause of diabetes. For every 100-milligram-a-day increase in magnesium intake, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes falls by around 15 percent.

Two tablespoons of pumpkin seeds contain 74 milligrams of magnesium. This is around a quarter of the recommended daily amount.

One study found that fisetin, a substance contained in strawberries, prevented both kidney and brain complications in mice with diabetes.

Other human studies have suggested that a higher intake of berries lowers the risk of diabetes.

One cup of fresh strawberries contains 160 percent of an adult's daily needs for vitamin C at only 50 calories. Several studies have shown a link between lack of vitamin C and diabetes.

Chia seeds are rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, fiber, magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium.

High-fiber diets are linked with stable blood sugar levels and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Despite this, most adults are still not meeting their daily fiber needs.

Just 1 ounce of chia seeds provides 10 grams of fiber, almost half the daily recommendation for a woman over 50.

Anti-inflammatory diets and foods can help to treat and relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term diseases like diabetes. Plant-based foods that are high in antioxidants are at the top of the anti-inflammatory foods list.

Ginger has been shown to be high in antioxidants and healthy compounds that enhance its anti-inflammatory powers.

Studies on ginger and diabetes are limited. However, research has shown that ginger reduces fasting blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

Low potassium intake is linked with a higher risk of diabetes and diabetes complications.

Spinach is one of the best sources of dietary potassium, with 839 milligrams per cup when cooked. One cup of banana has about 539 milligrams of potassium.

Cinnamon has been shown in some studies to lower blood sugars in people with diabetes, though not all studies agree. Participants in one study who took a high dose of cinnamon reduced their average blood sugar levels from 8.9 percent to 8.0 percent. Participants who took a low dose of cinnamon reduced their average blood sugar levels from 8.9 to 8.2 percent. Participants who did not take cinnamon saw no change.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Drivers weigh more than cyclists, study finds","People who use cars as their primary form of transport may be putting their health at risk, after research reveals they weigh more than cyclists.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312288.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness","Drivers weigh more than cyclists, study findsThe findings come from an international team of researchers - led by Dr. Audrey de Nazelle from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom - who analyzed the data of around 11,000 adults across Europe.

The research forms a part of the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) project, which aims to gain a better understanding of how different forms of transport influence the physical activity and overall health of the general public.

Lack of exercise is considered a key contributor to poor health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), insufficient physical activity is one of the primary risk factors for death across the globe, raising the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

Despite these well-documented risks, 1 in 4 people worldwide fail to get enough exercise.

For their ongoing project, Dr. de Nazelle and colleagues surveyed 11,000 adults from seven cities across Europe, including Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Oerebro, Rome, Vienna, and Z rich.

Participants were asked about what mode of transport they use to get around their city and how long they spend traveling using their reported form of transport.

Additionally, respondents reported their weight and height, as well as how they felt about walking and cycling.

So far, results have revealed that respondents who reported using a car as their main mode of transport are an average of 4 kilograms - or 8.8 pounds - heavier than those who reported using a bike as their main form of transport.

While these are early findings, the team says they indicate that switching to more active modes of transport, such as walking or cycling, has significant health benefits by boosting physical activity.

""If people can integrate this into their daily lives, such as going to work or going shopping, then it means you don't have to make special time commitments and it's more affordable for everybody. Getting people to walk and bike as part of their daily transport modes is really an ideal solution to try to tackle this epidemic of physical inactivity.""

The researchers note that they are not yet able to confirm a causal association between mode of transport and weight, but they hope that with their ongoing PASTA project, firmer conclusions will be reached.

The team hopes to follow a total of 14,000 adults from the seven European cities, and they are still looking for volunteers. If you are interested in participating, visit the PASTA website.

"Medical News Today: Food commercials change children's eating priorities","Researchers find watching food commercials changes children's brain activity, influencing their food decisions by altering taste preferences.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312312.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Pediatrics / Children's Health","Food commercials change children's eating prioritiesThe food industry spends around $1.8 billion a year marketing products to children and adolescents. Children between the ages of 2-5 years are estimated to view more than 1,000 advertisements per year, and teenagers almost 2,000.

Food marketing is cited as a substantial environmental factor in food choices and overeating, and, as a result, obesity, and TV advertising and branding have been shown to affect both food familiarity and preference.

Previous research indicates that children who view advertisements are more likely to prefer branded foods than children not exposed to advertisements. Behavioral studies have reported an association between receptivity to food commercials and the amount of food consumed.

Other studies have observed that children who are overweight may be more responsive to food branding and, as a result, are at a greater risk of being influenced by marketing. Research has demonstrated a relationship between marketing junk foods and an increased risk of childhood obesity.

A previous study by lead study author Amanda S. Bruce, Ph.D., assistant professor of behavioral pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, documented individual differences in brain activation in response to food advertising cues, such as fast food brand logos.

When observing food brand logos, obese children demonstrate reduced neurofunctional reactivity in the prefrontal cortex - a cortical region known to be associated with self-control.

In the new study, Bruce, together with researchers from the University of Kansas Medical Center and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, aimed to examine children's food decision processes and brain activity during active food selections.

Specifically, the team wanted to find out if food choices and brain activity were altered after viewing food commercials.

The research, published in The Journal of Pediatrics, centered on 23 children between the ages of 8-14 years. The children provided taste and health ratings for 60 food items based on how tasty and healthy they thought they were.

Bruce and colleagues studied the children's brain activity - with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - while making food choices after watching food and non-food TV commercials.

""For brain analyses, our primary focus was on the brain region most active during reward valuation, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,"" says Bruce. During the brain scan, the children were asked whether they wanted to eat the food items shown to them immediately after the commercials.

Results highlighted that, overall, children's decisions on the foods they wanted to eat were driven by tastiness rather than healthfulness. The taste of foods was even more of a factor after watching food commercials - that is, children favored specific foods and placed an even greater emphasis on taste attributes of these foods.

The researchers found that watching food commercials changed the way children assess the importance of taste when making food choices. The authors write: ""It is possible that the food commercials prime children to focus on the more hedonic aspects of food.""

""Food commercials may prompt children to consider their liking and wanting of specific food items, irrespective of the lack of any health benefits. This increased emphasis on taste may make it even more difficult for relevant caregivers to encourage healthy food choices. This evidence has implications for policies related to food advertising to children,"" they add.

When compared with non-food commercials, the vmPFC area of the brain that is associated with reward and value assessment showed increased activity at the time of food choice after watching food commercials. This activity indicates that food commercials stimulate children's brains in a way that non-food commercials do not.

Also, the more hunger the child reported, the greater the vmPFC activity, suggesting that when children are hungry, the effect of food commercials on brain activity may be particularly noticeable.

Obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents over the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The percentage of American children aged 6-11 years who were obese increased from 7-18 percent between 1980-2012, and similarly in adolescents of 12-19 years, increasing from 5-21 percent in the same period. The exploitative nature of food advertising directed at children prompts concern about the potentially harmful effects food commercials may have on children's health.

According to the American Heart Association, although many countries across the world tightly control or ban food advertising and marketing aimed at youth, this is not the case in the U.S.

Children and teenagers spend more than $180 billion each year, and they influence their parents' spending for another $200 billion per year. The American Heart Association notes that 84 percent of foods advertised as healthy do not meet basic nutritional standards, and 86 percent of food advertisements viewed by children are for products high in fat, sugar, or sodium.

The study results show that watching food commercials may change the way children value taste, increasing the potential for children to make faster, more impulsive food choices.

Future studies by Bruce and co-workers may focus on brain activity differences between lean and overweight or obese children when making food decisions after watching commercials, and the distinction between healthy and unhealthy food choices.

"Medical News Today: Blood vessel-forming protein could offer alternative to heart bypass surgery","Using mouse models, researchers shed light on how a protein called AGGF1 forms new blood vessels, which could help treat heart disease and heart attack.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312280.php","Sun, 14 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Heart Disease","Blood vessel-forming protein could offer alternative to heart bypass surgeryCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, responsible for more than 370,000 deaths in the country every year.

The condition arises when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, partially or fully blocking the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. This blockage can cause heart attack, angina - severe chest pain - and, over time, heart failure.

While lifestyle changes - such as adopting a healthy diet and regular physical activity - are considered key to improving CAD, some patients may require heart bypass surgery, which can help restore blood flow to the heart.

But, as with all surgery, it has its risks. These include chest wound infection, bleeding, stroke, heart attack, and kidney or lung failure.

In the new study - published in the journal PLOS Biology - researchers reveal how a protein called AGGF1 triggered new blood vessel growth, effectively bypassing blocked blood vessels, to treat heart attack in mice. What is more, there was no surgery in sight.

The process by which new blood vessels grow is called angiogenesis, and it was already known that AGGF1 promotes this activity. Exactly how the protein does so, however, has been unclear.

Researchers speculate that uncovering the mechanisms by which AGGF1 triggers angiogenesis could lead to a new treatment for CAD, heart attack, and other ischemic diseases - a treatment termed ""therapeutic angiogenesis.""

For this latest study, the researchers - including Qing Kenneth Wang from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - firstly looked at how AGGF1 affects human endothelial cells, which are cells that form new blood vessels.

Early in AGGF1 exposure, the team found that the endothelial cells demonstrated autophagy - a naturally occurring process by which the body eliminates unwanted debris, such as toxins or damaged cell components.

By assessing the hearts of mice that had been treated with AGGF1, they found that endothelial cells and other types of heart cells responded to the protein with autophagy.

On applying autophagy-inhibiting drugs to human endothelial cells exposed to AGGF1, they were able to block angiogenesis. This, the team says, suggests AGGF1 needs autophagy in order to promote new blood vessel growth.

To further confirm their theory, the team genetically modified mice to have mutations in one or both copies of the AGGF1 gene.

The mice that had mutations in both copies died as embryos. While 60 percent of mice that had one working copy of the gene survived into adulthood, these mice showed lower levels of autophagy in their hearts.

In the next part of the study, the team studied a mouse model of myocardial infarction, or heart attack.

When heart attack occurs, this causes damage to heart tissue. The researchers found that alongside damaged heart tissue in the mouse models came an increase in AGGF1 levels, which they speculate is down to reduced oxygen in the damaged tissue.

Treating these mice with additional AGGF1 increased the number of rodents that were alive 2-4 weeks later, the team reports. What is more, the treatment improved heart structure and function, as determined by echocardiogram.

Compared with mouse models of heart attack that were not treated with AGGF1, mice that were treated with the protein showed increased autophagy and angiogenesis, increased heart cell survival, and less tissue scarring following heart attack.

Further investigation led to the identification of another molecule that is involved in AGGF1-induced angiogenesis, known as JNK; blocking this molecule with drugs stopped AGGF1 from forming new blood vessels.

Additionally, the researchers found that blocking autophagy through drugs or mutations in genes needed for the process stopped AGGF1 from promoting angiogenesis, and it also hindered the repair of heart tissue damage following heart attack.

This finding, the team says, provides further evidence that autophagy is needed in order for AGGF1 to trigger angiogenesis.

While the process by which autophagy induces angiogenesis remains unclear, the researchers say their findings shed light on how AGGF1 can be utilized to form new blood vessels, paving the way for non-surgical heart bypass:

"Medical News Today: HIV: Newly discovered component could lead to more effective drugs","Scientists have uncovered a feature that HIV uses to infect cells while avoiding  immune system detection. This finding could lead to improved treatments.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312291.php","Sun, 14 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","HIV / AIDS","HIV: Newly discovered component could lead to more effective drugsHIV weakens a person's immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. Only certain body fluids - blood, semen, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk - from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the United States. Although there is no cure for HIV infection, improved treatments allow people living with HIV to slow the virus' progression and stay relatively healthy for several years.

HIV is a part of a subtype of viruses called retroviruses, which means that the virus is composed of RNA - instead of normal DNA - and has the unique property of transcribing RNA into DNA after entering a cell.

This retroviral DNA can then integrate into the DNA of the host cell and remain undetected by the immune system. The infected cell can produce virus cells with different RNA genomes, which restarts the infection cycle. This unusual method of infection and replication has made it difficult to develop a vaccine for HIV.

Previously, it was unknown exactly how the virus gets the genetic building blocks it needs to synthesize the DNA to infect the host cell. However, the research team has made new discoveries into this mechanism.

A protein shell known as the capsid surrounds the virus. The researchers found that the capsid contains iris-like pores that open and close like an eye.

The pores can open and close very quickly, enabling them to ""suck in"" the genetic building blocks called nucleotides that the virus needs to build the DNA to infect the cell, while keeping out any unwanted molecules. This helps to explain why HIV is so successful at evading the immune system.

The discovery, published in the journal Nature, was made by examining the atomic structure of the capsid and creating mutant HIV viruses, which allowed the team to see the behavior of the pores.

Dr. Leo James, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology, says: ""We used to think that the capsid came apart as soon as the virus entered a cell but now realize that the capsid protects the virus from our innate immune system. The channels we've discovered explain how the fuel for replication gets into the capsid to allow the viral genome to be made.""

To prevent the virus from copying itself and infecting more cells, the scientists developed an inhibitor molecule - hexacarboxybenzene - that can block the capsid pores. The molecule successfully blocks the pores, ensuring that the virus can no longer replicate itself, rendering it noninfectious.

The hexacarboxybenzene molecule is unable to enter human cells, and, therefore, cannot help with any cells that have already been infected with HIV.

However, the researchers indicate the findings could lead to both future drugs that can enter human cells and block the pores from within and greater effectiveness of existing treatments, by altering them to penetrate pores.

Additionally, this new prototype molecule could assist in the development of drugs to treat other retroviruses.

""This collaborative work between Leo James's laboratory at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, and Greg Towers at University College London really illustrates the value of taking an interdisciplinary approach to discovery research,"" says Dr. Tim Cullingford, programme manager for chemical biology at the MRC.

""The combination of atomic-level structural work with virology has enabled them to make a finding that will shape the direction of future work in this area,"" he concludes.

"Medical News Today: Better cultural fit may encourage healthy eating","A study of adults from the U.S. and Japan finds whether a person adheres to a healthy diet may depend on how well they fit with their country's culture.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312252.php","Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","Better cultural fit may encourage healthy eatingIn a study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, researchers suggest individuals with a better cultural fit are more likely to engage in healthy eating.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans say a healthy diet is one that is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, low in saturated fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars, and which includes lean meats, poultry, eggs, and low-fat dairy products.

According to the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), adhering to such a diet can reduce the risk of overweight and obesity, which can lower the likelihood of chronic diseases, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

However, it goes without saying that not all of us stick to the recommendations when it comes to healthy eating; a report from the CDC last year revealed that less than 18 percent of adults in the U.S. eat enough fruits, and less than 14 percent consume enough vegetables, while another CDC report found more than 90 percent of Americans consume too much salt.

While the CDC and other health organizations have launched initiatives in an attempt to encourage Americans to eat healthily, the new study suggests that such initiatives may yield more success if they incorporate U.S. culture.

Led by Cynthia Levine, of the Department of Psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, the research team analyzed the dietary habits of adults from the U.S. and Japan.

Both countries have very different cultures, the researchers note; U.S. culture has more emphasis on independence and the right to make one's own decisions, while Japanese culture is more focused on interdependence and maintaining good relationships.

All study participants reported how often they consumed certain foods each week, including fish, vegetables, and sugary drinks. The team also gathered information on their eating habits when under stress.

Additionally, participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with statements that aimed to determine how well they fit into the culture of their country.

Such statements included, ""I act in the same way no matter who I am with"" (representing independence), and ""My happiness depends on the happiness of those around me"" (representing interdependence).

Subjects with greater scores on independence had a better fit with U.S. culture, while those with higher scores on interdependence had a better cultural fit in Japan.

The study results revealed that Americans who scored higher on independence were more likely to follow a healthy diet - which included higher amounts of fish and vegetables, and a lower intake of sugary drinks - than those who scored lower on independence.

Additionally, Americans who were more independent were less likely to use food as a coping mechanism when feeling stressed.

""In the U.S., having choice and control and being independent are very important,"" says Levine. ""Giving people lots of healthy choices or allowing people to feel that they have control over whether they eat healthy options is likely to foster healthier eating.""

Among Japanese adults, the team found those who scored higher on interdependence had healthier eating habits than those who had lower scores on interdependence.

""Instead, in Japan, promoting healthy eating is likely to be most effective when it builds on and strengthens social bonds,"" says Levine.

Overall, the researchers say their findings suggest a person's cultural fit may influence what foods they eat, and that healthy eating plans should take culture into account.

The researchers now plan to conduct further studies assessing how culture may influence everyday behaviors.

""We would like to explore how these cultural differences in the meanings of common behaviors can be utilized to encourage healthy eating or healthy behaviors,"" adds Levine.

If this enzyme is blocked, the cell's DNA becomes tangled, and the cell can no longer divide.

According to Cancer Research UK, between 1-10 in every 100 people experience infertility due to the use of etoposide. Chemotherapy can stop the ovaries from producing eggs temporarily or sometimes permanently, and some people experience early menopause.

Chemotherapy administration during the first trimester up to 12-14 weeks is often avoided, as it is associated with increased risk of congenital malformations and high risk of spontaneous abortion.

During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy from 4-9 months chemotherapy treatment if considered to be relatively safe for the developing fetus with several studies showing no birth defects in infants born to women receiving chemotherapy at that time.

However, this research shows that etoposide damages the development of lab-grown mouse ovary tissue and affects specialized cells - called germ cells - that lead to egg production. Further studies are needed to observe if the same effect is true in human tissue.

Experts caution that daughters of women who received chemotherapy during pregnancy should be informed that they might undergo early menopause.

Around 1 in 1,000 pregnant women are diagnosed with cancer, requiring consideration for the use of chemotherapy during pregnancy. However, little is known about the possible long-term detrimental effects of etoposide on the reproductive system of the unborn child.

The purpose of the research was to examine the effect of etoposide on germ cells in the developing ovary.

The reproductive lifespan of a female is determined before birth - during the second and third trimesters - when female germ cells form structures called follicles that determine how many eggs a woman will be able to release in her lifetime.

Lead researcher Prof. Norah Spears, of the University's Centre for Integrative Physiology, and colleagues conducted a mouse study that examined the effects of etoposide treatment on lab-grown ovary tissue.

At around 17 weeks of gestation, fetal follicle development starts and continues into the later stages of pregnancy.

Results indicated that 90 percent of germ cells were eliminated when treatment commenced prior to follicle development. However, when treatment took place after the follicles had developed, no significant adverse effects were observed.

The study, published in BMC Cancer, also suggests that any genetic damage to germ cells during fetal development could then be passed on to subsequent generations, called the ""grand-maternal"" effect.

The authors write that the findings are cause for concern, especially since etoposide is already prescribed to pregnant women, and the drug may potentially have a similar effect in human fetal ovaries to mice.

The potential for adverse effects on fetal ovarian development when etoposide is used in pregnant women during the second or third trimesters - at which point pre-follicular female germ cells are sensitive to the detrimental effects of this compound - may not become apparent until many years later, the study concludes.

"Medical News Today: Schizophrenia symptoms eased with aerobic exercise","Around 12 weeks of aerobic exercise was found to significantly improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with schizophrenia in a new study.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312299.php","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Schizophrenia","Schizophrenia symptoms eased with aerobic exerciseThe researchers - including Joseph Firth of the Institute of Brain, Behavior and Mental Health at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom - publish their findings in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin.

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder estimated to affect around 1.1 percent of American adults.

Symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations, delusions, abnormal thought processes, and agitated body movements. Some individuals with schizophrenia may also experience cognitive symptoms, such as problems with memory, executive function, and attention.

Schizophrenia has no cure, but there are treatments that can help manage symptoms. These include antipsychotic medications and psychosocial therapies.

Now, Firth and colleagues suggest aerobic exercise should be added to the treatment regimens of patients with schizophrenia, after finding it could improve their cognitive functioning.

The researchers note that a number of previous studies have hailed exercise for its neurocognitive benefits, but that to date, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of how physical activity might affect the cognitive functioning of people with schizophrenia.

With this in mind, the team conducted a meta-analysis of 10 controlled trials involving a total of 385 individuals with schizophrenia. All trials looked at how exercise - predominantly aerobic exercise - affected patients' cognitive functioning.

The analysis revealed that schizophrenia patients who completed around 12 weeks of aerobic exercise - alongside their usual schizophrenia treatment - had better cognitive functioning than those who did not engage in aerobic exercise.

In detail, the team found aerobic exercise significantly improved the attention, social cognition - the ability to understand social situations - and working memory of individuals with schizophrenia.

Aerobic exercise refers to physical activity in which the large muscles of the body move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period, such as walking, swimming, and cycling.

The researchers note that individuals with schizophrenia who engaged in greater amounts of aerobic exercise showed the biggest improvements in cognitive functioning, and exercise programs that were best for improving physical fitness were also most beneficial for cognition.

According to the authors, these results provide evidence that physical activity can improve the cognitive functioning of patients with schizophrenia.

""We are searching for new ways to treat these aspects of the illness, and now research is increasingly suggesting that physical exercise can provide a solution,"" notes Firth.

These connections are responsible, unsurprisingly, for signaling hunger and satiety.

More surprisingly, gut-brain connections also play a role in signaling love, fear, safety, and danger.

As with other networks, they utilize a cocktail of neurotransmitters; one of the chemicals commonly used is dopamine, known for its role in reward and addiction.

The interaction between gut and brain has recently been implicated in a number of brain-based disorders, including Parkinson's disease, autism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety.

It is only now that the complexity and ramifications of these relationships are coming to light.

A study, published this week in Current Biology, investigated whether drugs designed to manipulate dopamine signaling, such as antipsychotics, could have an effect on inflammation. In other words, could drugs that work on the nervous system affect the immune system, two biological systems that, until recently, were considered to be separate entities.

The research group was headed up by Alejandro Aballay, Ph.D., a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke School of Medicine in Durham, NC. He believes that the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model to study the gut-brain interaction.

C. elegans' nervous system contains just 302 neurons, compared with a fruit fly's 250,000 or a human brain's 100 billion; they also have a very basic immune system.

Aballay and his team first noted a gut-brain-immune interaction in C. elegans during a study they carried out in 2009. The team bombarded the nematodes with a range of chemicals in the search for compounds that would help protect the creatures from bacterial infection.

Of more than 1,000 drugs, 45 were found to switch on the immune pathway. Half of these drugs worked on the nervous system, and a few of them blocked dopamine activity. This finding provided the basis for the current study.

For this next phase, the team set out to investigate the effects of dopamine and dopamine signaling pathways on the nematodes and their immune system.

They blocked dopamine's effects using a drug normally used for manic depression and schizophrenia, called chlorpromazine. When C. elegans was introduced to a common bacterium - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - it was more resilient to attack.

Conversely, when the team applied dopamine to the worms, they became more susceptible to infection.

As theorized, the researchers showed that by manipulating dopamine levels in the C. elegans, they could control inflammation in the gut.

The team believes that dopamine signaling controls the body's inflammatory response so that it is prevented from running amok - as it does in certain autoimmune conditions, where the immune system turns its weapons on healthy cells.

Prof. Aballay continues: ""We are talking about an existing set of drugs and drug targets that could open up the spectrum of potential therapeutic applications by targeting pathways that fine-tune the inflammatory response.""

Although the jump from nematode to human is a sizable one, Prof. Aballay hopes that targeting the nervous system to influence the immune system could ""potentially be used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn's disease"" in the future.

Prof. Aballay plans to continue his research into the fine-tuning of the immune system. As we learn more about the gut-brain-immune interaction, our view of the ways in which our bodies are influenced looks set to be substantially changed.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Mid-range 'good' cholesterol levels associated with longer life","Low and high HDL cholesterol levels have been associated with an increased risk of premature death, while intermediate levels decrease the risk of death.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312289.php","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Cholesterol","Mid-range 'good' cholesterol levels associated with longer lifeCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that the body needs to help build cells; it is carried through the bloodstream and attaches to proteins called lipoproteins.

If blood vessels are damaged, cholesterol can be deposited, eventually causing narrowings. People with kidney disease are more likely to have problems with narrowings in their blood vessels than healthy people.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as the ""good"" cholesterol due to the way it assists with removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and taking it to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from the body. Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are linked to a lower risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke.

Patients with kidney disease often have lower HDL cholesterol levels, which could account for their higher risk of early death. The research team aimed to investigate the relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and premature death in kidney disease patients.

Benjamin Bowe, M.P.H., of Washington University School of Medicine, and Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., FASN, of Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System, and colleagues retrospectively studied 1,764,986 American male veterans.

Participants were chosen who had at least one measurement of kidney function and one measure of HDL cholesterol between October 2003 and September 2004, and they were followed until September 2013 or death.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), desirable levels of HDL cholesterol should be around 40 mg/dL or above.

However, findings from the study indicate that both low HDL cholesterol levels less than 25 mg/dL and high HDL cholesterol levels above 50 mg/dL were linked to an increased risk of premature death during follow-up. While intermediate levels between 25-50 mg/dL reduced the risk of early death, thus forming a U-shaped relationship between HDL cholesterol and mortality risk.

In the presence of kidney disease, the beneficial properties of intermediate HDL cholesterol levels were not as strong, but they remained significant.

""The finding that high HDL cholesterol was also associated with higher risk of death was not expected and has not been reported previously in large epidemiologic studies such as the Framingham Heart Study and others,"" says Dr. Al-Aly.

""Prior epidemiologic studies significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between cholesterol parameters and clinical outcomes; however, these studies are limited in that the number of patients in these cohorts is relatively small compared with the current Big Data approach,"" he adds.

He notes that a Big Data approach to the investigation allows a more refined examination of the relationship between HDL cholesterol and risk of death across the full spectrum of HDL cholesterol levels.

In a previous study, Bowe and Al-Aly found that low levels of HDL cholesterol increase the risk of incident kidney disease and its progression.

"Medical News Today: Bone Marrow Biopsy: What to Expect","What happens during a bone marrow biopsy? This article looks at how bone marrow biopsies are carried out, how long they take, and whether or not they hurt.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312292.php","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 06:00:00 PDT","Surgery","Bone Marrow Biopsy: What to ExpectA bone marrow biopsy is a medical test that helps doctors check the health of blood cells. A health provider may do the procedure when there might be a problem with the production of blood cells.

The health provider inserts a small needle into a large bone. The needle takes a sample of the bone marrow. Then, the tissue sample is sent to a lab for analysis.

Answers to commonly asked questions about a bone marrow biopsy are below.

Bone marrow is the soft tissue that is inside most large bones. Bone marrow makes a lot of the body's blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Stem cells within the bone marrow produce various blood cells. There are two main types of stem cells in bone marrow called myeloid and lymphoid cells.

Myeloid cells create red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Lymphoid stem cells produce a specific type of white blood cell responsible for immunity.

Blood is made of different components and plays an important role in maintaining health. Bone marrow makes these components. Red blood cells play a vital role by carrying oxygen throughout the body. White blood cells, of which there are several different kinds, are important to help the body fight infection. Platelets help stop bleeding by helping blood to clot.

Health providers order bone marrow biopsies when there are signs or symptoms that something is wrong with blood cell production.

Bone marrow biopsies are also used for patients with blood-related cancers to see how their treatment is working. They can be used to check the progress of chemotherapy.

There are many symptoms and medical conditions that can be diagnosed or evaluated using a bone marrow biopsy. Some of these diseases and conditions include:

The procedure may be done in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic. The biopsy itself takes about 10 minutes and the total time spent is around 30 to 45 minutes.

Before the bone marrow biopsy, a health provider will ask questions to ensure the safest care. Preparing a list of questions and medical history can help speed the process.

The health provider will ask about medications or herbal treatments that can increase bleeding. Bone marrow biopsies carry a risk of bleeding.

Common pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen can also increase bleeding. Anticoagulants or blood thinners such as heparin and warfarin also are known to increase bleeding risk.

The health provider will provide instructions about whether to continue taking medications or stop them before the procedure.

Allergies are an important concern with a biopsy. The health provider will ask about allergies, especially to anesthetics and latex, which is found in surgical gloves.

Anesthetics may be used during the procedure, so patients should ask a friend or family member to drive them home.

How a bone marrow biopsy is carried out varies by doctor. Generally, the process takes two steps:

A bone marrow biopsy is usually done on an outpatient basis, but some patients may have the procedure done while in the hospital. A bone marrow biopsy is commonly done with the pelvic bone, but other bones may be used.

The steps of a bone marrow biopsy are generally as follows:

Before the biopsy, the patient changes into a gown. The health provider will ask the patient to lie on their side or stomach. The position may vary based on biopsy site. The provider then cleans the biopsy area with an antiseptic.

The doctor applies an anesthetic with a needle to numb the biopsy area. There may be some pain when the needle is applied and the anesthetic is released into the area.

Once the biopsy site is numb, the doctor makes a small incision at the biopsy site. Bone marrow aspiration is often carried out first. The doctor will use a syringe to take a liquid sample of the bone marrow cells.

After the aspiration, the doctor carries out the bone marrow biopsy. The process involves using a larger needle than the one used during the aspiration. The doctor guides the needle into the bone, rotates it, and then removes a sample of bone and tissue.

There is usually some pain during and after the procedure. The level of pain varies among people.

Studies have identified ways to make bone marrow biopsies more comfortable. Having an experienced health provider is important to reducing pain. Pain control medications such as lidocaine and intravenous sedation can also ease pain during the procedure.

Anxiety and worrying about the procedure often make the experience more painful. People who are anxious about a bone marrow biopsy should talk to their doctor. Doctors are familiar with the different options to relieve pain or anxiety that comes with a bone marrow biopsy.

The results may be ready a few days after the biopsy but can take longer. A pathologist or a doctor specializing in blood called a hematologist will analyze the samples. The health provider will then explain the results and there may be follow-up tests.

The biopsy area may be sore and could hurt for several days. Patients should follow their provider's instructions about which pain relievers are acceptable to use. Some pain relievers including aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding.

The doctor will give instructions about keeping the area dry and when the protective bandage may be removed. The bandage usually stays on for 1 to 2 days.

There are symptoms to watch for that signal an infection or complication. Patients should talk to their health provider if experiencing the following:

Bone marrow biopsies are generally safe, but there is a risk of complications. Some of the more common problems can include:

There may be other risks depending on the medical condition of the patient.

Direct examination of bone marrow is important in assessing certain blood diseases, including cancer. The doctor obtains information that is useful for choosing the right treatment. No other tests can provide such precise information.

New tools such as automated drills are under development. A clinical trial of a battery-operated drill has found it to be faster in extracting bone marrow, with patients reporting less pain.","Pharmaceuticals"

The new Phase I/II trial - called SPIRE and run by the charity's Centre for Drug Development and the Experimental Cancer Medicines Centre (ECMC) network - will test a drug called guadecitabine (SGI-110) in combination with chemotherapy to see if it can treat the disease and stop patients becoming resistant.

Astex Pharmaceuticals' guadecitabine is a type of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that blocks molecules that can modify DNA. In cancer these molecules turn off genes that should be on, causing resistance to chemotherapy.

The first part of the study will give small doses of the drug to between three and 36 patients with advanced solid tumours, including bladder, lung, stomach and oesophageal cancers, to ensure it is safe and to find the most effective dose, after which it will be tested in 20 bladder cancer patients to gauge its effectiveness.

""Advanced bladder cancer can be a difficult disease to treat and we desperately need to improve our treatment options. Our trial offers a new approach to tackling resistant bladder cancers and there's promising lab research to suggest it might benefit patients,"" said Simon Crabb, trial lead from the Southampton ECMC.","Healthcare"
"Cataract operations being rationed, warns RNIB","The Royal National Institute for the Blind claims that its research continues to show cataract operations are being restricted due to financial pressures on the NHS.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/cataract_operations_being_rationed,_warns_rnib_1100582","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 09:13:12 +0100","NA","The Royal National Institute for the Blind claims that its research continues to show cataract operations are being restricted due to financial pressures on the NHS.

In response to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's comments last week that any patient needing cataract surgery should get it ""without delay"", the charity says ""this just isn't happening"", and that some are being forced ""to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life"".

In a letter to the Health Secretary, it stressed that cataract surgery is still being rationed for financial reasons, despite it being approved by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The recent case where St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) recently announced but then retracted its statement that it would temporarily suspend routine operations in a bid to save cash is ""just one example of decisions being made as a result of cost-cutting rather than clinically-led"".

""Whilst St Helens CCG has now dropped these plans, they are still exploring ways to save money and we're concerned this could include cataract surgery,"" the charity noted, adding: ""no decision about me without me"" principle means that patients should have the opportunity to discuss the merits and risks of surgery with a professional. However, this is being significantly undermined as a result of CCGs' arbitrary policies"".

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) has also expressed concerns about potential rationing and postponement of second eye cataract surgery which, it stressed, should also be performed based entirely clinical need.

""The [College] understands the financial pressures the NHS faces but we believe that any restriction, postponement or delay in cataract surgery made through commissioning decisions will not produce the efficiencies or cost savings expected,"" said its president Professor Carrie MacEwen.

The RCOphth anticipates an increase of around 50 percent in the number of cataract operations needed over the next 20 years due to an ageing population, but insists that cataract surgery ""is a highly cost effective and efficient surgery that has a rapid effect in restoring a patient's vision and preserving their ability to live an independent life"".

The RNIB has asked for the Health Secretary's support in calling on commissioning groups to ""urgently implement"" NICE-accredited cataract commissioning guidance to secure the best and most appropriate care for patients.","Healthcare"

The Danish biotech is planning to enrol around 160 patients in the Phase II trial, which is designed to explore the benefit of combining CV301 with Opdivo in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

CV301 targets two tumour-associated antigens, CEA and MUC-1, which are over-expressed in major cancer types, including lung, bladder and colorectal cancer.

Preclinical data have shown CV301's ability to up-regulate PD-L1 by mounting an immune response against a tumour target, presenting an opportunity for a greater response in patients who might otherwise not benefit from treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor alone, the firm noted.

Under the deal, Bavarian Nordic continues to retain all commercial rights for CV301, and there is no obligation on behalf of BMS, beyond the contribution of drug material.

According to the workforce survey, published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, than more than half of paediatric units are failing to meet recommended staffing standards, leaving 89 percent of clinical directors concerned about how child health services will cope in the next six months (up from 78 percent last year).

The survey found that more than one in four general paediatric posts at senior trainee level are now vacant, and that 60 percent of tier 1* and 77 percent of tier 2** rotas, which are mainly made up of junior doctors, have not been able to attract the full complement of 10 full-time staff.

Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Clark, workforce officer at the Royal College, warned that the paediatric workforce is at breaking point and children's healthcare is increasingly being compromised.

""There is no escaping the fact that an increase in junior and consultant posts is urgently needed, coupled with a radical re-design of services,"" he said.

However, because it can take eight years to complete paediatric training and as long to implement service alterations, the RCPCH has made a number of immediate recommendations to help sustain services for children in the short-term, including a breakdown of barriers to multi-disciplinary working, an increase in children's nurses and immediate opportunities for GP colleagues to access child health training.

According to Dr Clark, continuing to deliver the service as it currently stands is not sustainable. ""I urge decision makers to increase trainee and consultant numbers, better map training places to demand, and plan emergency and non-emergency rotas well in advance"".

*Tier 1 rotas are mainly made up of trainees with a small number of Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANP), Specialty and Associated Specialty Grade (SASG) and Trust doctors; Tier 2 rotas are mainly consist of more senior trainees, with a small number of ANP, SASG and Trust doctors.

The British Medical Association's junior doctors committee is now seeking approval for a new spate of industrial action - the nature of which remains unclear - starting in September, over remaining concerns relating to the contract.

Back in May the government and NHS Employers reached a ""historic agreement"" with the trade union on a new contract for junior doctors after more than three years of negotiation and strike action. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 68 percent of BMA members voting.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt then confirmed that the government would push through the contract in its current form, despite widespread objection.

Now, in a letter to members, Ellen McCourt, chair of the Junior Doctors Committee, said: ""I have continued to push for improvements which would demonstrate the Secretary of State for Health was serious when he stated in Parliament that his door was always open.

"NHS patients missing out on cancer drugs","Thousands of NHS patients in the UK are missing out on access to innovative treatments that are available to patients living in some other countries of comparable wealth, finds new research by charities Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nhs_patients_missing_out_on_cancer_drugs_1099505","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 11:31:13 +0100","NA","Thousands of NHS patients in the UK are missing out on access to innovative treatments that are available to patients living in some other countries of comparable wealth, finds new research by charities Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK.

According to their report, 'International Comparisons of Health Technology Assessment', a key reason for the UK's poor performance on access is the rigidity of the its appraisal systems, in that they lack the opportunity for negotiation on drug prices.

The report reviewed the drug systems and the availability of breast and prostate cancer treatments in England, Scotland and Wales compared to five similar countries: Germany, France, Australia, Canada and Sweden.

It shows for example that Roche's Kadcyla (trastuzumab-emtansine) - a drug that can offer women living with incurable secondary breast cancer an extra six months of life on average launched two and half years ago - is available in Germany, Canada and France, but can only be accessed by patients in England throughout the Cancer Drugs Fund and not at all in Scotland and Wales.

Looking at global health technology assessment bodies, the research also highlights that, in many cases, they play a key role in access but are only one part of a wider process, and notes the opportunity for assessment of peer systems to gauge whether any elements could be applied to improve access to cancer drugs for NHS patients.

The charities are now calling on the Secretary of State for Health to review the current role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as well as work on renegotiating the current arrangements for the Pharmaceutical Pricing Regulation Scheme (PPRS) in time for 2018, ""so that price negotiation can be brought into the system, enabling patients to access the best available treatments at prices that the NHS can afford"".

""This report demonstrates the need for serious reform of the way our health system assesses, and determines the availability of, the cancer drugs that patients rely upon,"" said Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now.

""Pharmaceutical companies must indeed start offering more responsible prices. But until our health bodies are empowered to negotiate the price of cancer drugs, patients in the UK will continue to miss out on new treatments being offered elsewhere"".

However, commenting on the report, Dr Paul Catchpole, Director Value and Access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said it is ""too simplistic"" to suggest that the problem is just down to an inability to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies.

""Companies engage in pricing negotiations with the NHS but without doubt there is room for more creative approaches. This is despite the UK already having some of the lowest prices for medicines among similar economies and a deal which has seen companies pay back over  1.3 billion pounds to the Government in the last 18 months to help keep NHS spending on medicines affordable"".

He went on to say that the concerns of the cancer charities ""are real"", and that ""the NICE evaluation program hasn't kept pace with innovation and relies too much on a basic cost effectiveness threshold for assessing value for money and which remains unchanged in over 15 years"".

""With cancer medicines now more effective than ever in extending life, we are seeing scenarios where some new medicines used in combination with established treatments would be rejected by NICE even if they were given away free due to the fact that patients are taking them for longer. The bottom line is that the system we have in the UK for assessing medicines needs to further evolve"".

""Only when we see a fundamental shift away from medicines being used as a cost containment exercise rather than part of a sustainable NHS will we begin to improve services for patients. If we want to improve survival rates for our patients we should be prepared to invest more, not less,"" he argues.","Healthcare"

The survey, involving more than 1,000 NHS workers in primary care, including GPs, practice nurses, practice managers and their colleagues, also revealed that work is considered the most stressful area of their lives, ahead of their finances, health, family life and relationships.

Two in five (43 percent) said workplace stress had either caused them to resign or think about resigning, while 21 percent reported having developed a mental health problem as a result and, in 8 percent of cases, even led to suicidal thoughts. Also of note, 17 percent said stress led to them taking medication for a mental health problem.

On the physical side, 83 percent said workplace stress affects their ability to sleep and more than (54 percent) impacts directly on their health, and caused one in six to call in sick to avoid work.

Compounding the problem, healthcare staff feel unable to share that they are experiencing high levels of stress at work; 31 percent thought that disclosing this would lead to them being perceived as less capable than their colleagues, while 22 percent said it might count against them when being considered for a promotion.

""These figures paint a worrying picture, suggesting that levels of stress among primary care staff are having a real impact on both their mental and physical wellbeing,"" said Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. ""We need to make sure that health care professionals are well and supported, so they can provide the best care for their patients"".

Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said the poll reinforces his organisation's own finding ""that GPs and their staff are under unsustainable pressure because they are having to work long, intense hours on dwindling resources against a backdrop of rocketing patient demand. As this Mind survey demonstrates, the inevitable side effect is rising levels of burnout and stress"".

""Many GPs are considering cutting their working hours and one in three told a recent BMA survey they were considering retiring in the next five years. This is not only distressing for the individuals involved, but will seriously limit the capacity of the NHS to deliver quality care to patients"".

""The current state of general practice is pushing GPs to their limit, and these results show it is having a serious impact on their physical and mental health. It goes without saying that a service that relies on sick and fatigued GPs is not good for patient safety,"" added Dr Maureen Baker, Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

But she also stressed that NHS England's GP Forward View ""is a lifeline for general practice, and the pledges - including  16m to support GPs suffering from burnout and stress - will go a long way to alleviating the current pressures facing GPs, and in turn improve patient care"".","Healthcare"

"PROMS show health improvement post surgery","Patients undergoing four common elective procedures on the NHS are reporting significant health gains, according to annual data garnered from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/proms_show_health_improvement_post_surgery_1097172","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 09:20:14 +0100","NA","Patients undergoing four common elective procedures on the NHS are reporting significant health gains, according to annual data garnered from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).

The PROMs Programme began in 2009, with patients asked to complete a questionnaire before and after their operation to demonstrate what benefits were delivered and whether they had any surgical complications.

The move came as part of a wider strategy to give patients more influence over NHS resources and more power to drive improvements, as well as strengthen commissioning.

Patients are asked to report on their outcomes at three months after groin hernia and varicose vein surgery, and six months after hip and knee replacements.

In 2014/15, a total of 267,046 PROMs-eligible procedures were carried out, and the findings show that most patients reported improvements to health following their surgery: 96.4 percent of those with hip replacement; 93.2 percent with a knee replacement; 82.3 percent of those who had varicose vein surgery; and 49.9 percent of those who underwent groin repair surgery.

The data also reveal that between one in five and one in three patients report at least one post-surgical problem, depending on the condition: 27.5 percent of patients responding after a hip replacement; 31.7 percent of knee replacement patients; 20.7 percent of groin hernia patients; and 22.7 percent of varicose vein patients.

""The PROMs programme provides hugely valuable insight into the care the NHS provides,"" said Dan Wellings, head of Insight & Feedback at NHS England. ""Trusts and CCGs can use it to understand what they are doing well and where they need to improve.""","Healthcare"
"NHS continues to miss key A&E, cancer targets","NHS performance data for June is again showing greater demand across both urgent and emergency care and elective areas, as well as the service's continued failure to hit key waiting times and cancer targets.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nhs_continues_to_miss_key_a_and_e,_cancer_targets_1097170","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 09:18:07 +0100","NA","NHS performance data for June is again showing greater demand across both urgent and emergency care and elective areas, as well as the service's continued failure to hit key waiting times and cancer targets.

The figures show a 3.7 percent increase in emergency admissions, a 6 percent rise in diagnostic testing, and 4 percent growth in consultant-led treatment.

A&E attendances were up 3.3 percent, and 90.5 percent of patients were admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours of arrival, falling below the 95 percent standard.

In the case of elective care, standards were met for six of the eight cancer standards, but the 85 percent standard for 62-day cancer waiting times was not met, with just 82.7 percent of patients beginning a first definitive treatment within 62 days from an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer.

Similarly, the 93 percent standard for two week wait referrals for patients with breast symptoms (where cancer not initially suspected) was not met, with 91.9 percent of patients being seen by a consultant within 14 days from an urgent GP referral.

Also of note, there were 171,298 days of delayed transfers of care in June 2016, compared to 139,538 in June 2015, marking a hefty rise of 23 percent during the period, indicating a lack of cohesion between the different factions of care.

Commenting on the performance figures, Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said they ""once again illustrate the strain the NHS is under to maintain timely access to high standards of care in the face of huge financial pressures"".

""The recent and important relaxation of some targets, and of the penalties for missing them, will give many hospitals much-needed opportunity.

"NHS England launches consultation on HIV PrEP","NHS England has today launched a 45-day public consultation on a proposed clinical commissioning policy on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nhs_england_launches_consultation_on_hiv_prep_1096333","Thu, 11 Aug 2016 10:20:19 +0100","NA","NHS England has today launched a 45-day public consultation on a proposed clinical commissioning policy on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV.

The organisation has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support a proposal for routine commissioning of the service for specific sub groups of adults at high risk of HIV acquisition.

It says there has already been ""extensive engagement"" on this policy, which has been developed with the support and input of lead clinicians and patient and public representatives, and that the consultation is being run without prejudice to the outcome of an appeal following a judicial review.

NHS England is currently appealing a recent High Court decision that it does actually have the legal power to commission the PrEP service because, it argues, the service, being a preventative measures, falls under the remit of local authorities.

The draft commissioning policy has been published for consultation pending a ruling from the Court of Appeal, so that a system can be put in place as quickly as possible once a final decision is reached, NHS England said.

However, it also stressed that ""this does not imply that PrEP - at what could be a cost of  10-20 million a year - would actually succeed as a candidate for funding when ranked against other candidate interventions in this year's annual specialised commissioning prioritisation round, but it is a necessary condition for such an assessment to take place"".

Recent evidence indicates that the PrEP approach can be highly effective in preventing transmission of the disease as long as the drugs are taken regularly; data from the pilot phase of the PROUD study show that PrEP using Truvada cut the incidence of HIV infection by 86 percent.

The once-daily pill costs around  360 a month, according to the AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, but it points out that this is still cheaper than the cost of treating HIV, which has been estimated at around  360,000 over a life-time.","Healthcare"

It s really only the beginning. The use of the data will continue and in 10, 20 years from now people will be doing different things with the data than we ever imagined.  Michael Kinsella of Servier

Industry stakeholders have insisted that it could be a costly mistake to view serialisation as a project which only concerns engineering matters. As serialisation data is unique to the pack it requires not only the deployment of new treatment but also expanded staff investment and stakeholder engagement. Therefore,  To characterize it as an engineering issue is therefore to grossly underestimate its consequences, which touch virtually every business function in pharmaceutical manufacturing. 2

The updating of hardware for packaging lines may on first appearances seem to be a usual project comprising of routine timescales and considerations. However, some cases in the market have conveyed that installing and commissioning integrated serialisation ready hardware ends up being considerably more complex than first assumed. 2 New equipment capabilities have to be met in response to data requirements  including multi-substrate inks for TIJ printers and printer abilities to perform to aggregation and verification.

Effective data management is imperative to achieve regulatory compliance with a serialisation programme. Non-standard data exchange and integration methods are seen as one of the biggest hurdles in serialisation compliance.4 These projects will also incur a surge in the amount of data shared between trading partners, with the volume of data units being determined by the length of the supply chain in question.

In light of the data responsibilities expected within serialisation projects, Pharma IQ consults with a selection of experts on software best practices - data integration and implementation.

Download the early draft agenda for the Serialisation and Traceability Event  taking place from 02-04 November, 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland. Download the agenda here

Pharma firms should have a clear map of their current and their target architecture, due to the evolving ecosystem that operates in many pharma companies. Michael Kinsella, Program Director, Serialisation & Traceability at Servier notes that the pharma firm is currently rolling out a SAP implementation at their main sites simultaneously alongside other rationalisation projects concerning historical IT systems.

So, here, a clear roadmap is imperative to ensure Servier is synchronized with their master data requirements to fulfill the needs in a timely fashion.

In response to partnership interaction with CMOs, Michael Kinsella from Servier noted:  The CMO area is quite tricky and it s often left until the last step because there is a lot of hesitancy about specifying  responsibilities. Who s going to pay for the interfaces? You may even have equipment that needs to be put into the CMOs to perform some of the data exchanges, you may need scanners, you may need relabeling, you may need reprinting or re-aggregation capabilities in order to be able to send data back to a mother system and to maintain the integrity. So it s really quite complex.  He adds that assessing CMO interaction is often underestimated. CMOs usually wait for the client to explain their needs, as it is the pharma companies who hold the marketing authorizations that are under the obligation to ensure boxes leave the factories in a conforming manner.

Depending on the responsibility or the contract held between various partners or the pharmaceutical company, it is not always completely clear what kind of investments the CMOs need to make and the interfaces they are responsible for.

 I think the first steps are not the specification of the interface itself   but more mapping out the relationship and the responsibility the business needs. - Michael Kinsella

This will involve categorizing the partners the pharma firm has, the type of CMOs and their responsibilities and requirements. Different arrangements may occur according to the authorisation of a product or the delegation of responsibility in the production, packaging and distribution of a product. Michael notes that in some cases pharma firms may decide not to  integrate their systems into, or to interface with the CMO s systems or exchange data. They may simply connect to the national database to which the data is transmitted to. In other cases, there may be a business need to exchange data to facilitate certain business activities, especially where the product is still in the possession of the pharma firm.  If the product has left their possession or has been sold, the responsibilities for the data integrity or data exchanges change somewhat.

"The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia","Bumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve","http://www.pharma-iq.com/medical-devices-and-diagnostics/articles/the-impact-of-cognitive-computing-on-healthcare-in","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 09, 2016</span>","NA","The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesBumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes. To find out more, we speak with Dr James Miser, Chief Medical Information Officer at Bumrungrad International Hospital, who describes the implementation process so far and how the technology is likely to transform healthcare.

  To date, Watson for Oncology has compiled nearly 15 million pages of medical content, including more than 200 medical textbooks and 300 medical journals.

  Watson can assemble and assess patient information along with relevant medical information from its entire database in less than a minute.

  Watson provides medical professionals with instant access to information from leading research institutions from around the world.

  At Bumrungrad International Hospital, staff will be using Watson to make their data organization more efficient and ultimately the system will help them decide on the best course of treatment for patients.

How is cognitive computing changing the way medicine is being practised?

Dr James Miser:  Medicine is changing dramatically, in large part due to our genetic and molecular understanding of ourselves and the diseases that we can contract. In essence, we re getting more complicated to medically understand. This leads to greater quantities of patient information and the necessity for more organisation of said information, along with more disease and treatment information. 

 Within the next 5-10 years, this mass of accumulated patient, disease and treatment information is going to become dramatically more complex. In order to give patients the best treatment  options, all of that data needs to be available immediately. This represents an immense challenge for physicians all over the world. Fortunately, a cognitive computing solution is able to absorb thousands of medical journals, textbooks, papers and guidelines from leading institutions in order to piece together the most appropriate data and outline the best course of action for the patient. 

Why is this of particular importance in Southeast Asia?

Dr James Miser:  The challenges in Southeast Asia are magnified because of the uneven distribution of  healthcare throughout the region, for example, the differences between major medical centres and more rural areas. If we can address this balance with cloud based cognitive computing solutions then I think we can have more of an impact here than anywhere else. 

Dr James Miser:  It s a cloud-based system meaning that primary, secondary and tertiary care centres would all have access to it. So even if a primary care centre was unable to properly diagnose a patient or provide the suggested treatment (many cancers require molecular diagnosis with advanced technological processes), its staff would be able to accurately determine where the patient needs to be referred to, with a clear idea of what tests and potential treatments may be  necessary. 

What benefits does using Watson give your colleagues in the oncology department at present?

Dr James Miser:   We re just about to start actively using Watson, which means we re piloting it after numerous test cases. So to be honest, initially the results will be modest but over time it will become more and more important as it is used in connection with a wider variety of cancers and cancer patients, especially in complex cases where the cancer regresses and then reappears often.

 Currently, it will help doctors using the system become more efficient as it helps organise the data, combine the relevant healthcare literature, provide roadmaps and so on. All of these processes will quickly become standardised too, which will allow healthcare professionals to practise in a more efficient and timely manner. 

So it s accurate to say that the benefits delivered by Watson haven t been fully realised yet and are going to increase significantly as more healthcare professionals become used to utilising it?



Dr James Miser:   Certainly. It s also going to deliver increased benefits for patients too in terms of helping to design more effective treatment plans. By March we re hoping to be able to present more concrete data regarding this area. The key issue is ensuring the information is available across the entire healthcare network, so that each medical professional involved is properly informed and can subsequently keep the patient properly informed at every step. In this way,

everybody benefits: the hospitals and healthcare professionals benefit financially and get a boost to their reputation, but more importantly, the patients will benefit. Instead of feeling cut off from the care that they need, they can go to their local healthcare facility and receive a diagnosis and treatment plan supported by the entire hospital network s expertise based on effective dissemination of information. 

Can you give a ballpark estimate regarding how much of an impact the system will have on oncology department efficiency rates?

Dr James Miser:  Cancer diagnosis requires the completion and analysis of multiple tests which Watson can carry out for the doctor. It can gather all of the patient s data, organise it and ensure it is complete before consulting its databank of medical literature and then making a suggestion on what the best treatment might be, based on its findings. All of this can be done in perhaps less than a minute   it s more to do with the speed of the internet than anything else. Moreover, it doesn t give just the best treatment option, it also suggests the next best option, and the next, with more options available if necessary. In some cases this is more for the patient to decide, because what s best for one patient may not be best for another, like whether or not to receive chemotherapy, for example. Essentially, Watson puts all of those options, all of the relevant data, literature and several other information tools right at the doctor s fingertips. It s really going to help them make efficient, informed decisions in a much more timely manner. 

We ve been talking primarily about Watson s impact on oncology. What other applications and impacts do you see this technology having?

Dr James Miser:   I think that Watson has wider applications to health in general. It can be applied to all types of cancer but it also has applications to the treatment of any serious or chronic disease because it can keep medical professionals updated on the latest practices, treatments and therapies as they are developed 

Will the costs of implementing Watson keep it prohibitively expensive for other less well-funded medical institutions?

Dr James Miser:   Watson was certainly expensive to develop but like any technology the costs of implementing it will decrease over time. For example, initially it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to map the human genome but now it only costs around $1000. In the same way, once Watson is applied more broadly, I imagine that the costs will decrease dramatically. There s even a case to be made by governments that its implementation will eventually save money as it improves healthcare efficiency. Ultimately, Watson can and should be implemented outside of the wealthiest institutions, because they already have the expertise, so they have less of a need for Watson s capabilities. It s in more remote and less specialised healthcare facilities in regions like South-East Asia that Watson will have the greatest impact on improving the overall health of the population and I believe that IBM and the other developers of Watson have that vision for their creation. 

What advice would you give any other healthcare organisation that is looking to integrate Watson into their existing processes?

Dr James Miser:  It s essential that you are able to link Watson to your medical staff effectively. Creating the right user interface and the right IT platform takes time, care, diligence and ICT expertise in order to create a scenario where your employees have a seamless connection to the expertise provided by Watson. So it s vital that you create a team of both ICT technicians and healthcare professionals to design that integration effectively. It s also very important to ensure that the right training in the use of Watson is carried out, so that everyone is up to speed with what it can do and how best to utilise its information tools.

 Due to its cloud-based nature, Watson isn t a simple  straight out of the box  tool; it does need some time and thought to go into its implementation. However, it is a fantastically user-friendly system and can be effectively integrated with any healthcare ICT systems. ","Pharmaceuticals"

The most popular professional social media networking website is LinkedIn which was acquired by Microsoft in June 2016 and has greater than 100 million registered users. With such a large outreach, these and other less well-known social media communication and networking websites are being utilised with increasing frequency by commercial organisations to communicate with existing customers as well as to lure new ones. In the case of the pharmaceutical industry, social media is now actively used to convey information relating to education, marketing, connecting with patients/physicians and receiving feedback. The major pharmaceutical companies have links on their websites to multiple social media websites and the potential of these is vast and thus far is largely untapped. However, statistics such as the number of visitors to these social media websites is comparable to those of other large industries such as finance and oil.

Benefits and risks of social media for the pharmaceutical industry

Safeguarding of information that the pharmaceutical industry disseminates via social media is essential. Although pharmaceutical industry websites contain a wealth of useful information, there appears to be a general apprehension in their use to disseminate medically relevant information [3]. The benefits of social media for the pharmaceutical industry are significant, such as its high outreach with messages being broadcast to other market segments [4]. A public hearing on the promotion of FDA regulated medical products using the internet and social media tools was held in 2009 with the presentations for all stakeholders that attended made available and this is a valuable resource [5]. Subsequently, a social media guidance webinar was held in July 2014 with all material also being publically available [6]. This is especially relevant, as the FDA have issued warnings in some cases where the existence of potentially objectionable information has been identified on social media websites [7]. The pharmaceutical industry should tread carefully in this territory, especially with third party data being a potential liability. This is because an imbalanced view of a product s risks and bene ts with erroneous claims being posted by such third parties (largely consumers) may capture the attention of regulators [8].

New trends and likely future directions

Despite the above caveats, social media offers significant benefits that should not be underestimated. Recent trends indicate encouraging signs of change as the latest raft of guidelines provides more clarity detailing new FDA guidelines [9, 10]. There are limitations of social media and the somewhat unclear regulations have impeded the pharmaceutical industry from utilising this channel whole-heartedly. However, the recent spate of laws governing social media use has brought more clarity to its use and may potentially embolden the pharmaceutical industry.

Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity","http://www.pharma-iq.com/clinical/columns/investigator-networks-cultivated-through-risk","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 02, 2016</span>","NA","Investigator networks cultivated through risk-factor trials, drives data diversity in dementia research. | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesExtensive investigator networks, cultivated over the course of some of the world s largest clinical trials into the risk factors for dementia, present an exciting opportunity for the future of dementia trials. Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and even depression have been linked to an increase in the likelihood of an individual presenting with dementia at some point in their lives. Indeed, the causes of dementia are as varied and as personalized as the disease s impact and symptoms. With dementia being one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide the social, economic and psychological impact on the individual, their family, their carers and the broader community, remains of critical interest to research organisations, physicians and pharmaceutical companies alike. As such, access to large clinical populations that represent a diversity of backgrounds and risk factors, could provide a solid foundation for the next major development in large-scale dementia trials.

The ways in which dementia impacts on an individual can manifest in different ways, depending on a number of contributing factors, such as the person s personality and their lifestyle prior to becoming sick. It is widely accepted that the symptoms of dementia are broken into three stages. These stages include:

The early stage: where the symptoms are relatively nuanced. Due to the gradual decline that is experienced in this stage, there is rarely any clinical intervention, despite, perhaps, the recommended alleviation of risk factors.

The middle stage: the disease becomes more prominent and the symptoms begin to impact on the individual, their family and/or their carer.

The late stage: is characterised by the individual s total incapacitation and complete dependence on their carer.  The physical and mental symptoms are obvious and memory disturbance is serious.

The length of time that it takes a patient to move through the three stages, again, is individualized. It is difficult to speculate how any one individual will interact with their physician s intervention. Due to the inconsistent/diverse appearance of symptoms and the broad range of contributing risk factors that may influence how the disease presents, developing a broad clinical population from which to derive data is critical in determining the efficacy and safety of any compound thought to alleviate symptoms and prolong the patients decline.

The scientific leadership that George Clinical engage with have been responsible for some of the world s largest studies into the risk factors that impact dementia.

 What George Clinical and its parent company- The George Institute for Global Health have achieved through their multi-regional trials [has] already had a significant impact on dementia,  Associate Professor Maree Hackett, Director of The George Institute s Neurological and Mental Health Division said.  The George s formidable track record in conducting large-scale, multi-regional trials into salt reduction, blood pressure lowering and stroke management, for example, have no-doubt made a significant dent in the instances of dementia globally. 

Stroke and blood pressure are two major contributors to the development of dementia. The INTERACT trials, led by George Clinical scientific leader, Professor Craig Anderson, is the largest ever clinical trial into acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) ever conducted with 2839 patients participating from 144 hospitals around the world. The study measured the impact blood pressure lowering has on patients after acute brain haemorrhage. The intervention appeared to reduce disability and improve quality of life at 3 months. Similarly, the ENCHANTED trial conducted with over 3000 patients globally, again led by Professor Craig Anderson, analysed the effect of two doses of a clot dissolving agent in acute stroke and showed that by giving a low dose, the risk of brain haemorrhage, a known side effect of this widely used drug, was reduced. These global trials, conducted across a diverse range of patients, countries, backgrounds and cultures provide a solid foundation for similar sized, similarly complex, trials into dementia.

Likewise, George Clinical scientific leader - Professor Bruce Neal leads the ongoing China Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS), the largest study of its kind, conducted in 600 rural villages across five northern provinces in China and Tibet. The study recruited 35 high risk individuals from each village, making a total of 21,000 participants. The rationale being that lowering salt intake will lower blood pressure and the stroke risk in this population. This approach to salt reduction has been identified by the World Health Organization as amongst the most cost-effective strategies for vascular disease prevention. The size, scale and impact of the SSaSS trial is staggering. The wealth of clinical data on one of the major risk factors for dementia, across one of the most populous regions on earth, provides future researchers with unparalleled clinical access and data sources.

 When conducting a clinical trial on something as complex as dementia, access to a largely trial-naive population with diversity demographic characteristics is key,  Associate Professor Hackett said.  The best thing about conducting clinical trials in the Asia-Pacific is that a large and diverse population is available, whose participation can produce definitive trial results   it is inherent to the region! 

As the world s population ages, and more people succumb to the debilitating impact of dementia, the capacity for researchers to access a diversity of clinical populations will be vital to the integrity of clinical trial data and the long-term sustainability of any intervention. Access to clinical populations throughout the diverse Asia-Pacific region, particularly to populations who have been identified as at risk, would provide a more robust data set for addressing a disease such as dementia.","Pharmaceuticals"

While mapping out the areas of interest specifically which would gain investment from pharma firms over 2016, Tom Macfarlane, drug development professional  noted:

 Much growth in the sector is being driven by expansion into developing markets, thus increasing demand for people with international experience. Taking the supply chain as an example, although track-and-trace initiatives should simplify and facilitate logistics in the long-term, in the short term there may be increasing competition for those with specialist knowledge of developing markets.

 Additionally, changes in the broader business model are driving a need for non-traditional skillsets and backgrounds, especially technology and the healthcare-provider/payor side. Pharma companies are digitising their internal processes and data, taking an increasing interest in electronic marketing as a more cost-effective alternative to large teams of sales-reps, and needing to obtain and make use data from patients and heathcare providers. One can see the reflection of this in the healthcare workstreams being pioneered by the tech giants, such as Apple, Google and IBM. 

The Pharma IQ team has conducted some research and compiled this ultimate guide on the pharmaceutical industry's top 10 firms based on the Forbes Fortune 500 ranking. The majority of pharma firms managed to improve their Fortune 500 rankings, with Celgene rising by 65 places.

Please note that the order follows that of the Fortune 500 rank.

First once again emerging first in the pharma industry ranking, J&J saw many successes over the past year, including its award winning efforts with the supply of an Ebola vaccine through Sierra Leone and joining the combat against the Zika Virus. This year saw the opening of JLabs in Toronto, a new 40,000-square-foot life sciences incubator, providing entrepreneurs shared lab space and offices, modular lab suites and access to scientific, industry and capital funding experts as they work to build important and successful early-stage companies.

However, the pharma giant has encountered some complications, for example with a court case arising focusing on alleged side effects of Johnson s baby powder. Also, media reports have noted that there may be a major restructuring in the firm to obtain cost savings, with expected net positions being eliminated from their global medical devices segment standing at around 3000.

Climbing one place in its Fortune 500 rank, Pfizer is reported to be providing 130 new jobs to manufacturing sites in Dublin and Cork. In Q3 of 2015, Pfizer finalised its acquisition of Hospira, Inc - a provider of injectable drugs and biosimilars. Additionally, following the termination of the potential Allergan merger, Pfizer announced that it is considering conducing strategic split in some form.

3 Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada)

Earlier this year, Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada) was reported to have paid US$20 million for an oncology drug produced by a team of scientists at Harvard. This is said to have been the highest upfront cash payment Harvard has ever received from a pharma licensing deal. In regards to the firm s Ebola Zaire, V920 (rVSV G-ZEBOV-GP, live attenuated): the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the vaccine candidate Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status.

Also,  Merck KGaA owned Sigma-Aldrich is reported to add 100 new jobs to its St.Louis base.

Making considerable progress on its ranking last year, Gilead Sciences has seen a number of wins recently, with the European Commission Grants Marketing Authorization for Gilead s Epclusa   also the firm has a a HIV-1 infection treatment in its pipeline. The firm saw year-on-year growth in total product sales in Q1 of 2016. Gilead s product Sovaldi ranked 3rd  in the world s top global pharmaceuticals in IMS  ranking.

Humira, labelled as the world s best selling drug for the past couple of years, has faced reports of potential competition this year as the US FDA accepted for review Amgen s Biologics License Applicaiont for ABP 501- labeled as a biosimilar candidate for Humira. Abbvie has achieved a number of drug approvals from regulators and have recently announced its oncology clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to assess the combination of Abbvie s Rova-T and BMS  Opdivo as a treatment for  relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Amgen s Enbrel is estimated to come in 6th in the ranking of top global pharmaceutical products in 2020 by revenue, charted to have accumulated US$7 billion in revenue by 2020. A patent suit has been brought in regards to this product in Q1 of 2016.

In the final quarter of 2015,  Eli Lilly and Merck s extended their Immuno-oncology Collaboration  to evaluate the fusion of Lilly s ALIMTA and Merck s KEYTRUDA. The combination therapy is said to be in Phase III and is focused on first line nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer.

Earlier in 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb signed an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Padlock   biotechnology company focused on the treatment of destructive autoimmune diseases. The deal is set to further strengthen the firm s immunoscience pipeline. Also BMS completed acquisition of Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc.   The trade contains complete rights to Cardioxyl s leading asset   CXL- 1427   which is in phase 2 of clinical development positioned as treatment for acute decompensated heart failure.

Last year Biogen was reported to have reduced its global workforce by around 800 people, in line with its corporate restructuring to focus its R&D pipeline which features Alzheimer disease candidates. Last month, Biogen s investigational alzheimer s disease treatment Aducanumab was accepted into European Medicines Agency s PRIME Program.

Celgene saw the most dramatic rise in ratings out of the Pharma Top 10 companies for 2016 - rising by 65 places. This firm was charted as the second fastest growing pharma company within the fortune 500 in 2015. Its cancer treatment Revlimid is attributed to be the engine behind this surge.  Also, Celgene has made a range of partnerships with small biotech companies.

In providing insight for job seekers in the pharma industry looking for their next opportunity, Tom Macfarlane noted:  Many job-seekers are inclined to focus on the larger multinationals, which they percieve to offer greater security and a greater potential for advancement. However these multinationals are doing an increasing amount of their research by partnering or backing smaller companies, including start-ups, with a view to acquiring them and their assets in the fullness of time. It can therefore makes sense to evaluate a potential employer based on their pipeline, rather than just their size. ","Pharmaceuticals"

A particularly challenging biochemical symphony, one that included movements in both RNA synthesis and RNA replication, had been played through, possibly for the first time in four billion years.

According to a study that appeared August 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists based at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) created a ribozyme that succeeded in replicating short lengths of RNA efficiently, and in performing transcription on even longer RNAs to make functional RNA molecules with complex structures. This virtuoso performance comes close to what scientists imagine an  RNA World  RNA replicator would have been capable of doing to support life before modern biology, where protein enzymes now handle gene replication and transcription.

The study, which was led by TSRI s Gerald F. Joyce, Ph.D., and David P. Horning, Ph.D., culminated in the PNAS article, which was entitled,  Amplification of RNA by an RNA Polymerase Ribozyme.  The article describes how the TSRI scientists used test-tube evolution techniques to tackle the decades-old challenge of creating an enzyme that could both replicate and transcribe RNA and thus support an RNA world.

The team started with an enzyme that had been developed and improved upon by other researchers since the early 1990s. The class I RNA polymerase ribozyme, as it has come to be known, can perform the basic task of RNA synthesis required for transcribing an RNA template into a functional RNA molecule by binding to a strand of RNA and using it as a template to stitch together a complementary RNA strand.

The team reported that it developed an improved polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even transfer RNA (tRNA).

 The polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR,  wrote the authors of the PNAS article.  Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. 

Prior forms of the ribozyme had been very limited in the RNA sequences they could handle and couldn't transcribe RNAs that have even moderately complex structures. Because of those limitations, they also could not perform full replication of RNA, which requires the transcription of a complementary strand back into a copy of the original.

""We found that the new ribozyme can handle most sequences and all but the most difficult structures, so we can use it to make a variety of functional RNA molecules,"" said Dr. Joyce.

Even when synthesizing the limited RNA sequences that the original class I RNA polymerase ribozyme could handle, the improved ribozyme, called 24-3, proved capable of stitching them together about 100 times faster than its ancestor could.

Turning to the much harder task of replication, the TSRI researchers found that ribozyme 24-3 could copy RNAs of up to two dozen nucleotides, achieving what biologists call ""exponential replication"" and creating as many as 40,000 copies of a target RNA within 24 hours.

The 24-3 ribozyme is thus the first ever to combine the two basic capabilities RNA synthesis and RNA replication necessary for a pre-protein, pre-DNA world of RNA life.

To generate and sustain a true ""RNA world,"" the new ribozyme will have to be improved further to enable the replication of longer, more complex RNA molecules crucially including the polymerase ribozyme itself. The Joyce laboratory is now driving its ribozyme toward that goal with further test-tube evolution experiments.

""A polymerase ribozyme that achieves exponential amplification of itself will meet the criteria for being alive,"" Dr. Joyce concluded. ""That's a summit that's now within sight.""","Pharmaceuticals"
"Green Doesn t Mean Go for Mice"," 
	Anyone who has tried to sleep in with the blinds raised on a sunny morning knows all too well that light affects sleep.

Yet, visible light, as detected by the human eye, represents an array of colors of various wavelengths. The evidence is continuing to mount suggesting that particular wavelengths affect sleep and wakefulness states within the brain.

Now, investigators led by scientists at Oxford University have published results from a recent study that shows blue light wavelengths keep mice awake longer, whereas green light wavelengths put them to sleep more easily. The researchers are hopeful that this new information will not only provide new insight into sleep and sleep disorders but could also have potential implications in future lighting designs.

For mice, which are mostly nocturnal, light is a sleep-inducer. Previous studies in mice and humans have shown that nonimage-forming light perception occurs, in particular photosensitive cells in the eye and involves a light sensor called melanopsin. Mice without melanopsin (Opn4 / ) show a delay in their response to falling asleep when exposed to light, pointing to a critical role for melanopsin in sleep regulation.

The Oxford researchers wanted to investigate this phenomenon further by studying sleep induction in mice exposed to colored light, i.e., the light of different wavelengths. On the basis of the physical properties of melanopsin, which is most sensitive to blue light, the researchers hypothesized that blue light would be the most potent sleep inducer.

However, much to their amazement, the scientist found that green light puts mice to sleep quickly, whereas blue light seems to stimulate the mice, although they did fall asleep eventually. Mice lacking melanopsin were oblivious to light color, demonstrating that the protein is directing the differential response.

 We assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep,  the authors wrote.  Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4 / ), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. 

The findings from this study were published recently in PLOS Biology in the article ""Melanopsin Regulates Both Sleep-Promoting and Arousal-Promoting Responses to Light. 

Additionally, the researchers found that both green and blue light elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in the blood of exposed mice compared with mice kept in the dark. However, corticosterone levels in response to blue light were higher than levels in mice exposed to green light. Interestingly, when the researchers gave the mice drugs that blocked the effects of corticosterone, they were able to mitigate the effects of blue light drugged mice exposed to blue light went to sleep faster than control mice that had received placebos.

The Oxford team feel this work adds the growing body of data concerning the effect of colored lights  on humans. For instance, previous work has shown that exposure to blue light a predominant component of light emitted by computer and smartphone screens recapitulates arousal and wakefulness in humans, as it does in mice.

""Despite the differences between nocturnal and diurnal species, light may play a similar alerting role in mice as has been shown in humans,  the authors remarked. Overall, the authors say their work ""shows the extent to which light affects our physiology and has significant implications for the design and use of artificial light sources.""","Pharmaceuticals"

 ""Our approach to gene editing is informed by the known benefits of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin,"" said Mitchell J. Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology and one of the study's lead authors. ""It has been known for some time that individuals with genetic mutations that persistently elevate fetal hemoglobin are resistant to the symptoms of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, genetic forms of severe anemia that are common in many regions of the world. We have found a way to use CRISPR gene editing to produce similar benefits.""

 

 Fetal and adult hemoglobin are two different molecular forms of the essential oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Hemoglobins are made up of different combinations of four molecular subunits. Sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia are caused by mutations in a gene encoding the adult-expressed  -subunit. Disease becomes apparent after birth as the levels of adult hemoglobin take hold and levels of fetal hemoglobin decline. These mutations can affect the survival of red blood cells and inhibit oxygen delivery to tissues, causing impaired function of different organs with devastating consequences for patients.

 

 Fetal hemoglobin lacks  -subunits and has  -subunits instead. Thus,  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease associated mutations, which impair the production or function of the  -subunit, do not cause problems with fetal hemoglobin, which can transport oxygen effectively in adults.

 

 Experts have known for some time that inhibiting or reversing "" -to- "" switching of hemoglobin subunits can raise levels of fetal hemoglobin in adults and significantly ameliorate the debilitating symptoms of  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease.

 

 ""Our work has identified a potential DNA target for genome editing mediated therapy and offers proof-of-principle for a possible approach to treat sickle cell and  -thalassemia,"" added Dr. Weiss. ""We have been able to snip that DNA target using CRISPR, remove a short segment in a control section of DNA that stimulates  -to-  switching, and join the ends back up to produce sustained elevation of fetal hemoglobin levels in adult red blood cells.""

 

 When the scientists edited the DNA of blood-forming stem cells derived from patients with sickle cell disease, they were able to activate those genes and produce red blood cells that had enough fetal hemoglobin to be healthy.

 

 Recently, scientists have used several gene-editing approaches to manipulate blood-forming stem cells for the possible treatment of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, including repair of specific disease-causing mutations and other strategies to inhibit  -to-  switching. All of these approaches remain untested in patients.

""Our results represent an additional approach to these existing innovative strategies and compare favorably in terms of the levels of fetal hemoglobin that are produced by our experimental system,"" said Dr. Weiss. Using genome editing to restore the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is an attractive possibility, because it can be achieved relatively easily using current technologies. The condition is known to be benign in people who inherit similar naturally occurring mutations.

 

 The researchers want to refine the gene-editing process further and perform other experiments to minimize potentially harmful off-target mutations before in-human clinical trials are considered.

Is There Anything They Can t Do? | News HighlightsA summer intern made an accidental discovery while working at Cornell University. Rather than simply exclaim  D oh,  he made a mental note of the phenomenon he stumbled upon. Then, years later, still at Cornell, the young researcher realized that his accidental discovery hydrogel donuts might satisfy all sorts of cravings in biotechnology.

The young researcher, Duo An, is currently a doctoral student in the laboratories of Dan Luo, Ph.D., and Minglin Ma, Ph.D., both of the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell. When he was a summer intern, An was making nanoclay hydrogels, injecting one solution into another to create a gel. But during one particular procedure, instead of direct injection, he dripped one solution into another. When the first solution entered the second, it created vortex-ring particles.

Eventually, it occurred to An that the vortex-ring particles, or tiny donuts, could be more useful than anyone might have imagined, especially if they contained, well, a filling not a fruit filling, as in a donut for human consumption, but a filling that would help the hydrogel donuts  hit the spot  in biotechnology applications as varied as cell encapsulation, three-dimensional cell culture, and cell-free protein production.

These possibilities were outlined in an article that appeared August 4 in the journal Nature Communications. The article,  Mass Production of Shaped Particles Through Vortex Ring Freezing,  describes how stable hydrogel or solid microparticles of a defined shape can be produced through a gelation or precipitation process. ( Freezing  in the article s title may be read as  gelation. )

According to the article, which was contributed by a group of scientists led by Drs. Luo and Ma, controlling the shape and speed of a fluid spray, as well as the speed of the chemical reaction within the spray s droplets, could yield different structures.

 During its formation, the fluid experiences a rich variety of intriguing geometrical intermediates from spherical to toroidal,  wrote the article s authors.  Here we show that these constantly changing intermediates can be  frozen  at controlled time points into particles with various unusual and unprecedented shapes. 

The Cornell researchers exploited their electrospraying technique to mass produce inorganic and organic particles, with their sizes well controlled from hundreds of microns to millimeters. Multitudes of vortex ring-derived particles (VRPs) were produced, up to 15,000 rings per minute, then frozen at precise time points.

 Guided further by theoretical analyses and a laminar multiphase fluid flow simulation, we show that this freezing approach is applicable to a broad range of materials from organic polysaccharides to inorganic nanoparticles,  the authors continued.  Moreover, compartmentalization and ordered-structures composed of these novel particles are all achieved, creating opportunities to engineer more sophisticated hierarchical materials. 

Dr. Ma admitted that the concept of using a doughnut-shaped encapsulation hadn't occurred to him, but made perfect sense: ""We knew the concept that a doughnut shape is better, but we never thought of making it until we saw it [from An].""

An advantage of the doughnut-shaped encapsulation over a spherical-shaped one is shorter diffusion distance the distance the encapsulated particle must travel to escape the capsule while at the same time maintaining a relatively large surface area.

This concept could pave the way for other as-yet-unknown applications of vortex ring freezing, according to Dr. Luo. For example, the Cornell scientists employed nanoclay hydrogel donut-microVRPs to encapsulate DNA molecules for improved cell-free protein production. The group s previous work had shown that the bulk nanoclay hydrogel protects DNA from DNase and hence enhances the cell-free protein production yield. Compared with a bulk nanoclay hydrogel, the donut-microVRP have a much higher surface area for mass transfer and are therefore ideal for protein production applications.

""Our hope is that this type of material in these shapes can be used much more extensively in other labs for whatever they're trying to do,"" noted Dr. Luo. ""There is a whole field devoted to just particles, but by default, they are all thinking in terms of spherical particles. Hopefully, this will add to that field of study.""","Pharmaceuticals"

A greater understanding of these defensive pathways would allow scientists to develop therapies that could precisely modulate the immune response in the treatment of virulent pathogens.

Now, immunologists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have identified the protein trigger in the body's quick-reaction innate immune system that specifically recognizes the influenza virus in infected cells and triggers their death. The researchers believe that the protein they identified called ZBP1 could provide much-needed hope for developing drugs to protect against influenza's sometimes lethal complication of pneumonia.

Viral pneumonia from influenza is often exacerbated by lung inflammation and cell damage caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system. The development of new therapies that would modulate ZBP1's action could allow the body to fight the virus by killing infected cells, but preventing that overreaction.

In the new study, the investigators sought to understand how the body's innate immune system is alerted to the presence of the virus and mobilizes to trigger infected cells to commit suicide. The innate immune system triggers the body's ""emergency response"" to invaders such as infections. This rapid attack gives the body's adaptive immune system time to generate antibodies that specifically target the virus or bacterium. Flu vaccines train this adaptive immune system to attack specific viral strains.

First, the research team uncovered the specific machinery that the innate immune system uses to induce cell suicide as controlled by type I interferon. Subsequently, the researchers began to search for the protein molecule that recognizes the virus and triggers the cell death machinery. Their experiments used cells from genetically altered mouse strains, in which genes for particular proteins are removed selectively, to discover whether the cells lacking that protein would commit suicide when infected with influenza.

Amazingly, they found that cells lacking ZBP1 were completely resistant to viral-induced cell death. The result was surprising because ZBP1 was known to sense foreign DNA in the cell, but the influenza virus uses RNA as its genetic material.

""Our discovery was totally unexpected,"" explained senior study author Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology. ""We never thought we would actually identify this molecule to be important in influenza viral infection because there is no DNA stage in the influenza life cycle.""

Further experiments revealed that ZBP1 was, indeed, a ""master assassin"" in the cell, responsible for triggering three separate cell-death pathways. Moreover, the team discovered that ZBP1 was particular for recognizing influenza. The sensor did not trigger cell death in response to other similar viruses or bacteria

The findings from this study were published recently in Science Immunology in an article entitled  ZBP1/DAI Is an Innate Sensor of Influenza Virus Triggering the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death Pathways. 

The St. Jude s team work also revealed that ZBP1 acts as a protein detector, not a DNA detector, sensing telltale viral-produced proteins in the infected cell. The scientists moved their studies into Zbp1-knockout mice strains infected with influenza. Due to the fact that the innate immune system wasn't killing off infected cells, the mice showed an increased viral load and delayed recovery. However, because the immune system wasn't able to overreact, the mice showed reduced lung inflammation and damage to lung cells and were protected from mortality.

""Since the pathology that we saw in the mice matches what is seen in humans, we will now explore translating these findings to humans,"" Dr. Kanneganti noted. ""If we can somehow modulate the activation of this pathway, then that will help to decrease the exaggerated inflammatory response that causes mortality during influenza infection.""

Lead author Teneema Kuriakose, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Kanneganti s laboratory, added that the timing of such drug treatment would be extremely critical, stating that  ZBP1 does an amazing job of killing off infected cells, but it would be very useful to modulate ZBP1 in later stages of the infection, when the uncontrolled inflammation causes damage.""

""We have shown that these molecules are important in viral infections, but now we want to test their role in other inflammatory conditions,"" Dr. Kanneganti concluded. ""ZBP1 is likely not dedicated to attacking only the influenza virus. Maybe it also plays other roles, and if we fully understand those roles, we can learn how to manipulate immune responses.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Their study (""Amine Synthesis via Iron Catalysed Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes with Alkyl Halides"") is published in Nature Communications.

The amines are one of the most important classes of chemical compounds today. Amines that contain a ring-like aryl group are used widely in pharmaceuticals, such as the top-selling drugs Abilify    (aripiprazole), Crestor  (rosuvastatin), Gleevec  (imatinib mesylate), and Lidoderm  (lidocaine patch 5%). The process of making different amines (amination) involves connecting an amine to an organic molecule. The amine itself must first be prepared in advance by the hydrogenation of anilines, which are used as a nitrogen source and are derived from nitroarenes.

Xile Hu, Ph.D., and Chi Wai Cheung, Ph.D., at EPFL developed a technique for making (hetero)aryl amines through the reductive coupling of nitroarenes with organic compounds, without needing to go through the aniline step first. Using an iron catalyst, the researchers were able to couple amines to a number of alkyl halides, a group of organic compounds widely used in commercial products.

 The method was shown to have a high tolerance to functional groups, including some that require protection under conventional amine synthesis, making them versatile and well suited for a broad range of applications, according to the investigators.

The new method allows chemists to synthesize alkyl or aryl amines directly from nitroarenes, which are often cheaper than anilines. Moreover, using nitroarenes directly is more step-economical than using anilines, because the latter have to be derived from nitroarenes anyway, add the scientists. In addition, certain anilines containing are difficult to produce, while their corresponding nitroarenes are readily available.

""From these points of view, the current method can be considered as a valuable alternative to the conventional amination methods such as direct alkylation and reductive amination,"" said Dr.Hu.","Pharmaceuticals"

The company had 52 employees as of December 31, 2015, of which 33 were engaged in R&D activities, according to its 10-K annual filing for 2015.

ProNAi said it incurred a one-time $2.8 million restructuring charge toward estimated close-out expenses for PNT2258.

The restructuring comes two months after the company revealed in June that PNT2258 showed only modest efficacy in the Phase II Wolverine trial, assessing the candidate in 61 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

ProNAi immediately suspended development of PNT2258 in DLBCL, after interim results showed a response rate of 8.1% overall and 15.8% in a subgroup of 19 patients with a performance status of 0-1, who were exposed to one to three prior systemic regimens and received at least eight doses of PNT2258 within 35 days of starting therapy. No response was seen in 10 patients with a performance status of 2 and/or four or more prior lines of therapy enrolled before the eligibility criteria were amended, nor in eight additional patients enrolled after the April 25 data cutoff date for the interim analysis.

PNT2258 won the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation for DLBCL in March, and earlier received a similar designation from the European Commission.

ProNai has shifted its R&D focus to advancing PNT141, a selective, oral small-molecule inhibitor of the Cdc7 kinase. According to ProNAi, PNT141 is a key regulator of both DNA replication and DNA damage response, making it a compelling emerging target for the potential treatment of a broad range of tumor types.

Legend has it the song was inspired by shortages another banana variety, the Gros Michel. Like the Cavendish, the Gros Michel was genetically uniform and vulnerable to blight. Ultimately it was taken out of cultivation, even though it was widely considered tastier than the Cavendish.

Could the Cavendish avoid the fate of the Gros Michel? Maybe, with the help of gene-sequencing technology, which has been used to unravel the DNA of P. fijiensis. Gene sequencing has also been used to discover how P. fijiensis and two closely related pathogens, P. musae and P. eumusae, have evolved into a lethal threat to the world s bananas. P. musae causes yellow sigatoka disease, and P. eumusae causes eumasae leaf spot disease. Of the three pathogens, P. fijiensis poses the greatest constraint to banana production worldwide.

By studying the genomes of these pathogenic fungi, scientists hope to find ways to ensure the sustainable production of the banana, the world s leading fruit crop. At present, the banana ranks fourth as a global staple food, with 140 million tons of bananas produced annually in subtropical and tropical regions. The banana industry could, however, be wiped out in just 5 10 years by fast-advancing fungal diseases. Already, the Sigatoka disease complex can reduce banana yields by 50 70%, if not controlled.

Genomic details of the pathogens threatening the banana appeared August 11 in the journal PLOS Genetics, in an article entitled,  Combating a Global Threat to a Clonal Crop: Banana Black Sigatoka Pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis (Synonym Mycosphaerella fijiensis) Genomes Reveal Clues for Disease Control."" The article, which was contributed by scientists based at the University of California (UC) Davis, and Wageningen University, suggested genomic insights could suggest ways to improve host resistance. Such insights could also inform sophisticated management of fungicide resistance in the pathogen.

 In the P. fijiensis genome sequence, we identified an effector that induced an HR [hypersensitive response]-like necrosis on a resistant banana accession but not on a susceptible cultivar,  wrote the article s authors.  If validated, this assay may be useful for identifying resistance in banana breeding programs. 

The authors also reported that the genomic sequence was used to develop highly polymorphic molecular markers for analyzing P. fijiensis field populations and to identify a strong enrichment (nearly 100%) for fungicide resistance markers in fungicide-treated banana plantations compared to untreated wild-type populations.  This rapid evolution of fungicide resistance poses an immediate threat to sustainable banana production,  the authors noted. They added, however, that the P. fijiensis genome could aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat the black sigatoka pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs.

Black sigatoka is airborne and affects the leaves of banana plants in small- and large-scale plantations, and without chemical control it results in huge yield losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the fruit, causing premature ripening.

""Black sigatoka has a huge social, ecological, and economic impact worldwide,  explained Gert Kema, professor in tropical phytopathology at Wageningen University.  Thanks to the sequencing of the DNA of the Pseudocercospora fungus, we are now gaining a greater insight into the interaction between the fungus and the banana plant. This provides us with leads for increasing the sustainability of banana cultivation, making it better for the environment, the local population, and the economy. For example, the insights offer us opportunities to develop a banana plant that is suitable for production and export, and which is also resistant against black sigatoka.""

This fresh understanding of the DNA of the black sigatoka fungus is also providing new information that is useful in the development of more effective and, hopefully, less environmentally unfriendly crop protection products. This could reduce the amount of fungicide spraying, which, in turn, would improve the quality of life of the people working in the plantations and those who live in the immediate surroundings.

""We have discovered that the two more destructive pathogens share a pattern of parallel changes in their core metabolic pathways that enables them to exploit more efficiently the nutrient resources available in banana,"" added UC Davis molecular plant pathologist Ioannis Stergiopoulos. ""Now, for the first time, we understand the genomic basis of the evolution of virulence in these fungal diseases, thus giving us an opportunity for intervention.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Most interestingly, the researchers found that bees could smell these subtle changes, as glasshouse experiments have shown that bumblebees prefer the infected plants over healthy ones. The Cambridge team believes that by indirectly manipulating bee behavior to improve pollination of infected plants by changing their scent, the virus is effectively paying its host back. Yet, this is not an altruistic mechanism, because it seemingly aids the spread of the pollen to susceptible plants, inhibiting the chance of virus-resistant plant strains emerging.

The authors of this new study, which was published recently in PLOS Pathogens in an article entitled  Virus Infection of Plants Alters Pollinator Preference: A Payback for Susceptible Hosts?  say that understanding the smells that attract bees, and reproducing these artificially by using similar chemical blends, may enable growers to protect or even enhance yields of bee-pollinated crops.

""Bees provide a vital pollination service in the production of three-quarters of the world's food crops. With their numbers in rapid decline, scientists have been searching for ways to harness pollinator power to boost agricultural yields,"" explained senior study author John Carr, Ph.D., head of Cambridge's virology and molecular plant pathology group. ""Better understanding the natural chemicals that attract bees could provide ways of enhancing pollination and attracting bees to good sources of pollen and nectar which they need for survival.""

CMV, typically transmitted by aphids and not by bees, is one of the most prevalent pathogens affecting tomato plants, resulting in small plants with poor-tasting fruits that can cause serious losses to cultivated crops. Not only is CMV one of the most damaging viruses for horticultural crops, but it also persists in wild plant populations, and the authors say their results suggest why.

""We were surprised that bees liked the smell of the plants infected with the virus it made no sense,  remarked Dr. Carr.  You'd think the pollinators would prefer a healthy plant. However, modeling suggested that if pollinators were biased toward diseased plants in the wild, this could short-circuit natural selection for disease resistance. 

""The virus is rewarding disease-susceptible plants,  he added,  and at the same time producing new hosts it can infect to prevent itself from going extinct. An example, perhaps, of what's known as symbiotic mutualism.""

The investigators describe findings that reveal a new level of complexity in the evolutionary  arms race  between plants and viruses, in which it is traditionally believed that plants continually evolve new forms of disease-resistance while viruses evolve new ways to evade it.

""We would expect the plants susceptible to disease to suffer, but in making them more attractive to pollinators the virus gives these plants an advantage,  noted Dr. Carr.  Our results suggest that the picture of a plant-pathogen arms race is more complex than previously thought, and in some cases, we should think of viruses in a more positive way. 

The blend of volatile organic compounds that plants emit has evolved to perform multiple functions, attracting pollinators and repulsing plant-eating animals and microbes. In the current study, the Cambridge team grew plants in individual containers and collected air with emissions from CMV-infected plants, as well as mock-infected control plants. Using mass spectrometry, the researchers could see the change in emissions induced by the virus. More importantly, they found that bumblebees could smell the changes.

""Bees are far more sensitive to the blends of volatiles emitted by plants and can detect very subtle differences in the mix of chemicals,  Dr. Carr stated.  In fact, they can even be trained to detect traces of chemicals emitted by synthetic substances, including explosives and drugs. 

Finally, the researchers used mathematical modeling to show how pollinator bias for infected plants can cause genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations over vast numbers of generations. With the global population estimated to reach nine billion people by 2050, producing enough food will be one of this century's greatest challenges. The researchers hope that their work will help address issues surrounding food security at local, national, and international scales.","Pharmaceuticals"

The company said its decision followed a discussion held Thursday with representatives of the FDA. Endo had sought approval on the basis of studies designed to evaluate the abuse deterrence of Opana ER based on its INTAC  Technology formulation, designed to increase tablet hardness using polyethylene oxide, a high-molecular-weight polymer.

Endo said it plans to continue its epidemiological research into abuse deterrence, noting that its withdrawal occurred  without prejudice to refiling  a supplemental NDA at a later date.

 We anticipate the generation of additional data and we will seek collaboration with FDA to appropriately advance Opana ER,  Sue Hall, Ph.D., Endo evp, CSO, and global head of R&D and quality, said in a statement.  We believe in the ability of OPANA  ER to continue making a difference in the lives of appropriate patients and remain committed to safely and effectively addressing the needs of the pain patient community. 

Endo said it had not assumed approval of the supplemental NDA in its financial projections for 2016. On Monday, when it released second-quarter results, Endo reaffirmed its 2016 financial guidance to investors. The company projected total revenue of between $3.87 billion and $4.03 billion, as well as diluted GAPP earnings per share from continuing operations of between $1.86 and $2.16.

Opana ER is Endo s biggest-selling brand-name pain management treatment and accounted for 13% of Endo s branded drug net revenues during the second quarter, generating $38.554 million.

However, Opana s net revenues slid 11% over Q2 2015, due to competition from generic drugs. Opana net revenues also fell by 11% during all of 2015, shrinking to $175.772 million

Endo generates nearly twice as much in net revenues from U.S. generics as from specialty drugs.","Pharmaceuticals"

In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka, Ph.D., a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University at the time, discovered how to revert adult connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) back into immature stem cells that could differentiate into any cell type. These so-called induced pluripotent stem cells won Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in medicine just 6 years later for their promise in research and medicine. Since then, researchers have discovered other ways to convert cells between different types. This is mostly done by introducing many extra copies of ""master switch"" genes that produce proteins that turn on entire genetic networks responsible for producing a particular cell type.

Now the Duke team has developed a strategy that avoids the need for the extra gene copies. Instead, a modification of the CRISPR genetic engineering technique is used to directly turn on the natural copies already present in the genome. These early results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete and persistent conversion than the method where new genes are permanently added to the genome. These cells could be used for modeling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines, and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy.

The study (""Targeted Epigenetic Remodeling of Endogenous Loci by CRISPR/Cas9-Based Transcriptional Activators Directly Converts Fibroblasts to Neuronal Cells"") is published in Cell Stem Cell.

""This technique has many applications for science and medicine. For example, we might have a general idea of how most people's neurons will respond to a drug, but we don't know how your particular neurons with your particular genetics will respond,"" said Charles Gersbach, Ph.D., the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and director for the Center of Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering at Duke. ""Taking biopsies of your brain to test your neurons is not an option. But if we could take a skin cell from your arm, turn it into a neuron, and then treat it with various drug combinations, we could determine an optimal personalized therapy.""

""The challenge is efficiently generating neurons that are stable and have a genetic programming that looks like your real neurons,"" says Joshua Black, the graduate student in Gersbach's lab who led the work. ""That has been a major obstacle in this area.""

In the 1950s, Conrad Waddington, Ph.D., a British developmental biologist who laid the foundations for developmental biology, suggested that immature stem cells differentiating into specific types of adult cells can be thought of as rolling down the side of a ridged mountain into one of many valleys. With each path a cell takes down a particular slope, its options for its final destination become more limited.

If you want to change that destination, one option is to push the cell vertically back up the mountain. That's the idea behind reprogramming cells to be induced pluripotent stem cells. Another option is to push it horizontally up and over a hill and directly into another valley.

""If you have the ability to specifically turn on all the neuron genes, maybe you don't have to go back up the hill,"" said Dr. Gersbach.

Previous methods have accomplished this by introducing viruses that inject extra copies of genes to produce a large number of master transcription factors. Unique to each cell type, these proteins bind to thousands of places in the genome, turning on that cell type's particular gene network. This method, however, has some drawbacks.

""Rather than using a virus to permanently introduce new copies of existing genes, it would be desirable to provide a temporary signal that changes the cell type in a stable way,"" said Black. ""However, doing so in an efficient manner might require making very specific changes to the genetic program of the cell.""

In the new study, Black, Dr. Gersbach, and colleagues used CRISPR to precisely activate the three genes that naturally produce the master transcription factors that control the neuronal gene network, rather than having a virus introduce extra copies of those genes.

The CRISPR system was administered to mouse fibroblasts in the laboratory. The tests showed that, once activated by CRISPR, the three neuronal master transcription factor genes robustly activated neuronal genes. This caused the fibroblasts to conduct electrical signals--a hallmark of neuronal cells. And even after the CRISPR activators went away, the cells retained their neuronal properties.

""When blasting cells with master transcription factors made by viruses, it's possible to make cells that behave like neurons,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But if they truly have become autonomously functioning neurons, then they shouldn't require the continuous presence of that external stimulus.""

The experiments showed that the new CRISPR technique produced neuronal cells with an epigenetic program at the target genes matching the neuronal markings naturally found in mouse brain tissue.

""The method that introduces extra genetic copies with the virus produces a lot of the transcription factors, but very little is being made from the native copies of these genes,"" explained Black. ""In contrast, the CRISPR approach isn't making as many transcription factors overall, but they're all being produced from the normal chromosomal position, which is a powerful difference since they are stably activated. We're flipping the epigenetic switch to convert cell types rather than driving them to do so synthetically.""

The next steps, according to Black, are to extend the method to human cells, raise the efficiency of the technique, and try to clear other epigenetic hurdles so that it could be applied to model particular diseases.

""In the future, you can imagine making neurons and implanting them in the brain to treat Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative conditions,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But even if we don't get that far, you can do a lot with these in the lab to help develop better therapies.""","Pharmaceuticals"

You have to be really careful how you extract the right signal. Because there is a lot of noise in the data,  he says.

Dr. Subramanian along with Dr. Umar Saif, chairman of the Punjab Information Technology Board, and a team of computer researchers were able to find the signal in the noise from more than 300,000 phone calls about dengue, a virus that is similar in transmission to Zika.

Those calls were to a health hotline set up to improve the surveillance and response times following a 2011 dengue epidemic in the densely populated province of Punjab. In that outbreak 21,000 cases were reported and more than 350 lives lost.

The team analyzed many data sources, some at a fine-grained town level, including call volume, hospital records, and weather conditions that impact the vector lifecycle. What emerged were patterns on case distribution that led to a forecasting idea says Dr. Subramanian. The team created a working dashboard that not only flags outbreaks but also provides an accurate forecast by location two to three weeks ahead of time.

 If you give a signal to a hospital two weeks before an outbreak, it s a big deal,  Dr. Subramanian says. Their results were published in Science Advances.

Hospitals in that region use that lead time to prepare special wards and prevent patient-to-patient spread of the infection and public health officials are able to implement targeted containment activities. The researchers plan to publish follow up data on these efforts.  So far the results have been promising,  he says.

Another study also on dengue transmission in Pakistan published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, found predictive clues in much bigger data more than 40 million mobile phone records. Dengue has been prevalent for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but newly emerging outbreaks in the northeast provided researchers with the opportunity to analyze how and when the disease spreads in a wired world.

The researchers were able to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.

 Mobile phone data provide dynamic population mobility estimates that can be combined with infectious disease surveillance data and seasonally varying environmental data to map these changing patterns of vulnerability,  says author Dr. Caroline Buckee, assistant professor at the Harvard T.H.

Approximately one dozen genes have variants that are associated with sociability, or with fear and aggression.

The gene variants were uncovered by researchers based at Nationwide Children s Hospital. According to these researchers, reduced-fear gene variants may have been involved in the domestication process. The researchers also assert that their findings are relevant not only to dog behavioral problems, but also to human anxiety disorders.

The new findings appeared August 8 in the journal BMC Genetics, in an article entitled,  Genetic Mapping of Canine Fear and Aggression.  In the near term, the findings could inform genetic tests that would reveal the risk of specific types of fear and aggression in dogs. In the long term, the findings could shed light on human anxiety disorders and aggression, violence, and criminality.

 We conducted genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of breed stereotypes for many fear and aggression traits across several hundred dogs from diverse breeds,  wrote the article s authors.  We confirmed those findings using GWA in a second cohort of partially overlapping breeds. Lastly, we used the validated loci to create a model that effectively predicted fear and aggression stereotypes in a third group of dog breeds that were not involved in the mapping studies. 

The researchers found that known loci variants (IGF1 and HMGA2) for small body size are associated with separation anxiety, touch sensitivity, owner-directed aggression, and dog rivalry. The researchers also notice that two other loci (between GNAT3 and CD36 on chromosome 18, and near IGSF1 on the X chromosome) are associated with several traits, including touch sensitivity, nonsocial fear, and fear and aggression that are directed toward unfamiliar dogs and humans.

""Our strongest focus is on specific genes related to aggression toward unfamiliar humans and dogs, which are associated with highly relevant genes at two genome regions,"" said Carlos Alvarez, Ph.D., principal investigator in the Center for Molecular and Human Genetics in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. ""Those genes are consistent with the core fear and aggression neural pathway known as the amygdala to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.""

Because these risk variants are common across dog breeds, the canine veterinary setting provides an ideal test bed for new therapies targeting those biochemical pathways. Once it is determined which neuronal circuits are affected by the risk variation, this will likely reveal drug targets that could be inhibited or activated to increase or decrease the emotional behavioral effects. Those findings can immediately be tested in pet dog patients under owner consent. And, if those therapies are effective in dogs, they can then be applied to humans with similar conditions. Knowledge of the affected pathways will also provide biomarkers that can be used to identify the patients who are most likely to respond to such treatments.

""This project has only just begun,"" noted Dr. Alvarez. ""We are continuing to identify and validate other genes associated with these traits, including the expansion of dog breeds studied and biological validation of the findings. We are excited about what this work will continue to uncover.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, can it be true that various microbes that constitute the oral microbiota negatively affect colorectal cancer (CRC)? A new study led by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has found evidence strongly suggesting that they can.

While some previous evidence alluded to common mouth bacteria worsening CRC in animals, it had not been clear how these microbes made their way to the gut to exert their adverse effects. In the new study, the Harvard investigators found evidence that microbes called fusobacteria might use the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors. Moreover, the research team was able to show exactly how these bacteria home in on colorectal tumors causing them to proliferate and subsequently accelerate colorectal cancer.

""As fusobacteria contribute to colon tumor development, revealing the mechanism that guides them to the tumor and why fusobacteria become abundant there might inform ways of blocking this,"" explained co-senior study author Wendy Garrett, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Center. ""Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, if we know how fusobacteria localize and become enriched in colon tumors, hopefully, we can utilize the same or similar mechanisms to guide and deliver cancer therapeutics to colon tumors.""

CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and microbes have recently begun to emerge as key factors influencing the development and progression of the disease. Recent studies have shown that fusobacteria promote the formation of colon tumors in animals and are enriched in human colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. But these studies left it unclear how bacteria from the mouth localize to, and become abundant in, colorectal tumors.

The research team had a suspicion that oral microbes might reach colorectal tumors through the bloodstream. To test this idea, the scientists injected fusobacteria into the tail veins of two mouse models with either precancerous or malignant colorectal tumors. Surprisingly, in both types of mice, the fusobacteria became enriched in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. The researchers also detected fusobacteria in the majority of human colorectal cancer metastases tested, but not in most samples taken from tumor-free liver biopsies.

The findings from this study were published recently in Cell Host & Microbe in an article entitled  Fap2 Mediates Fusobacterium nucleatum Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Enrichment by Binding to Tumor-Expressed Gal-GalNAc. 

Using human samples and mouse models, the researchers went on to discover that the Fap2 protein located on the surface of fusobacteria recognizes a sugar called Gal-GalNac, which is abundant on the surface of colorectal tumor cells.

 We identify a host polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that explicates fusobacteria abundance in CRC,  the authors wrote.  Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized by fusobacterial Fap2, which functions as a Gal-GalNAc lectin. 

Additional experiments showed that Fap2 mediates fusobacterial colonization of colorectal cancer tumors and metastases. Recent studies have demonstrated that this protein also impairs the ability of the host immune system to kill tumor cells. Taken together, the findings suggest that fusobacteria travel through the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors and then use their Fap2 protein to bind to host cells and proliferate in tumors, thereby accelerating colorectal cancer.

 F. nucleatum binding to clinical adenocarcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment,  the authors wrote.  Clinical fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or inactivated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells and established CRCs in mice. 

""The strengths are that the study involved both human samples and mouse models. The weakness is that the available mouse models for colorectal adenocarcinoma do not completely reflect the slowly developing disease in humans,"" noted co-senior study author Gilad Bachrach, Ph.D., associate professor in the Institute of Dental Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""Based on our findings, it's too early to say whether we can prevent mouth bacteria from traveling through blood to the colon and promoting tumor formation or if some people are more at risk than others.""

In future studies, the researchers will look to examine further how fusobacteria contribute to the development, growth, and spread of colorectal cancer. ""Although it may not be possible to prevent oral microbes from entering the bloodstream and reaching colorectal tumors, our findings suggest that drugs targeting either Fap2 or Gal-GalNac could potentially prevent these bacteria from exacerbating colorectal cancer,"" Dr. Garrett concluded.","Pharmaceuticals"

""This could allow us to investigate questions such as why some people genetically predisposed to a disease are protected from it? Why events during early life and adolescence have such a lasting impact on brain health? Is it possible to 'reset' gene expression in the human brain?""

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important regulators of gene transcription, and one group of HDACs has been linked to important brain disorders. Several established neuropsychiatric drugs are HDAC inhibitors, and others are currently being studied as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Martinostat was developed in Dr. Hooker's laboratory and is patterned after known HDAC inhibitors to bind to HDAC molecules tightly in the brain.

PET scans with Martinostat of the brains of eight healthy human volunteers revealed characteristic patterns of uptake, reflecting HDAC expression levels, that were consistent among all participants. HDAC expression was almost twice as high in gray matter as in white matter. Within gray matter structures, uptake was highest in the hippocampus and amygdala and lowest in the putamen and cerebellum. Experiments with brain tissues from humans and baboons confirmed Martinostat's binding to HDAC, and studies with neural progenitor stem cells revealed specific genes regulated by this group of HDACs, many of which are known to be important in brain health and disease.

""HDAC dysregulation has been implicated in a growing number of brain diseases, so being able to study HDAC regulation both in the normal brain and through the progression of disease should help us better understand disease processes,"" says Dr. Hooker, who is an associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. ""We've now started studies of patients with several neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and I believe Martinostat will help us understand the different ways these conditions are manifested and provide new insights into potential therapies.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Even in our modern, technological advanced times, we still like to think of ourselves as autonomous and well with our control. Yet, again in recent decades science has impressed upon our fragile egocentric minds that there are literally billions of microorganisms living on and within our bodies exerting an enormous, if not imperceptible, amount of influence on all of our systems. These communities composed primarily of bacteria outnumber all of the cells of the human body and work symbiotically with our systems, like a harmonious Lilliputian army hell-bent on keeping Gulliver running in tip-top shape.

Yet, as is often the case during various times in our lives, our biological systems run amok caused from either the relatively benign like an infection from a microbial pathogen, not unlike those that constitute our microbiomes, or from our cells turning against the collective and branching out on their own accord. It has come to the attention of many scientists in recent years that many of these biological perturbations have a link to the microbiome, either directly or indirectly. Even seemingly distant and somewhat disconnected systems such as the brain and the lumen of the intestinal tract have become inextricably linked to disorders like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, autism, and mood disorders.

 I believe that during the early (prenatal to adolescence) phase of human development when both gut microbiome and brain circuits are being programmed that gut microbiota may play a role in increasing the risk for autism spectrum disorders, ingestive behavior, depression, and anxiety,  explained Emeran Mayer, M.D., Ph.D., director of the UCLA Gail and Gerald Oppenheimer Family Center for Neurobiology of Stress and author of  The Mind-Gut Connection: How the Hidden Conversation Within Our Bodies Impacts Our Mood, Our Choices, and Our Overall Health,  which outlines the microbiome s impact on neurodevelopment and general neurological health.","Pharmaceuticals"

Although killer T cells are known to give cancer cells a pass early in tumor development, it is unclear whether they wink at driver mutations from the start, or whether they surveil these genetic aberrations before turning a blind eye. According to new research from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, killer T cells are vigilant at first, but soon become inattentive. This finding raises the possibility that killer T cells could regain their sense of mission, enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapies against cancer.

The new research appeared August 9 in the journal Immunity, in an article entitled,  Tumor-Specific T Cell Dysfunction Is a Dynamic Antigen-Driven Differentiation Program Initiated Early during Tumorigenesis.  This article describes how preclinical cancers were studied in mice to reveal the killer T-cell response. The killer T cells, the article explained, not only recognize changes that drive cancer, they also attempt to launch an immune attack on cancerous cells.

 Early during the pre-malignant phase of tumorigenesis, TST [tumor-specific CD8+ T] cells became dysfunctional, exhibiting phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional features similar to dysfunctional T cells isolated from late-stage human tumors,  wrote the article s authors.  Thus, T cell dysfunction seen in advanced human cancers may already be established early during tumorigenesis. Although the TST cell dysfunctional state was initially therapeutically reversible, it ultimately evolved into a fixed state. 

The authors added that persistent antigen exposure, rather than factors associated with the tumor microenvironment, drove dysfunction. Moreover, the authors indicated that TST cell differentiation and dysfunction program exhibited features distinct from T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections.

""Our results highlight that driver mutations, which theoretically would be the most effective antigens to target because they represent the basis for a tumor behaving as a tumor, are not immunologically silent and can indeed be recognized,"" said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center immunologist Phil Greenberg, M.D., who led the study along with Andrea Schietinger, Ph.D., a former Fred Hutch postdoctoral research fellow who now leads an immunotherapy lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

"Malaria Transmission Significantly Reduced Using Human Odor-Baited Traps"," 
	 
 
	 The use of a newly developed mosquito trap incorporating human odor has resulted in a 70% decline in the population of the most significant malaria mosquito on the Kenyan island of Rusinga. After the introduction of the odor-baited traps on the island, the proportion of people with malaria was 30% lower among those living in houses with a trap compared to people living in houses who were yet to receive a trap.  ","http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/malaria-transmission-significantly-reduced-using-human-odor-baited-traps/81253075/","NA","NA","Malaria Transmission Significantly Reduced Using Human Odor Baited Traps | News Highlights That makes combating malaria increasingly tricky and less environmentally friendly,  Dr. Takken continued.  Alternative methods are therefore urgently needed. As we use a natural lure namely human odor in our approach there is no negative impact on the environment, and it is very improbable that the mosquitoes will become 'resistant' to being captured. After all, the mosquitoes need their attraction to the lure in order to be able to survive.""

The findings from this new study were published recently in The Lancet in an article entitled  The Effect of Mass Mosquito Trapping on Malaria Transmission and Disease burden (SolarMal): A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Trial. 

The success of the new malaria control approach lies in its combinatorial strategy of using the odor-baited traps with mosquito nets, antimalaria drugs, and a solid social strategy. The traps require electricity to operate, but there is no central power supply on Rusinga, an island in Lake Victoria, so solar panels were installed on the roofs of homes. These not only provided electricity for the mosquito traps but also provided the homes with power for light and to charge a mobile phone. The use of solar energy to control malaria gave rise to the project name: SolarMal.

Thanks to this combined approach, all 25,000 inhabitants of Rusinga participated in the study. When the odor-baited traps are used, the use of insecticides to combat the mosquito population can be minimized avoiding any harmful side effects of such products. The Wageningen antimalaria approach, therefore, has had not only benefits in reducing the spread of malaria but also had positive effects on the living conditions of the population.

While the mortality rate due to malaria infections especially in children under the age of five still rank the disease as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, it is the morbidity associated with malaria that often gets overlooked, costing Africa $12 billion a year in health-care costs and lost productivity, particularly in the agricultural sector.

""The effect of the disease on agricultural production is hugely underestimated,"" Dr. Takken noted. ""As children with malaria need access to hospital care, their parents cannot work on the land and as a result food production rates decline. If those parents themselves also suffer from malaria infections four or five times a year, they are also not able to work for around 6 weeks. In such cases, extra labor needs to be brought in, or the crop will be lost. An African household loses 10% of its annual incomes through malaria. It is for good reason that reducing the prevalence of malaria was included in the ten-millennium development goals formulated by the UN.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) is aiming to eradicate malaria by 2030. To that end, investments are being made in the development of vaccines against the parasite and in combating the vectors of the parasite: the mosquitoes. The odor-baited trap dubbed the Suna trap represents an efficient and safe solution in the fight against the mosquito.","Pharmaceuticals"

""We have figured out a way to mine these data for the benefit of cancer patients.""

Dr. Okimoto and collaborators developed a computational algorithm called the Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by ITeration (JAMMIT), which uses advanced mathematics to identify different patterns across multiple molecular data types, such as gene expression and genetic mutations, that when taken together accurately predict what treatments would be best for a given cancer patient.

""The algorithm could accelerate the approval of powerful treatments for many cancers, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs for treating cancer. I believe this discovery can open a path to more precision medicine clinical trials that could be initated and run locally in Hawaii,"" said Randall Holcombe, M.D., incoming Director of the UH Cancer Center.

The findings (""Joint Analysis of Multiple High-Dimensional Data Types Using Sparse Matrix Approximations of Rank-1 with Applications to Ovarian and Liver Cancer""), published in Biodata Mining, highlight JAMMIT analysis of ovarian and liver cancer data pulled from private research labs and public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. The analysis identified small sets of genes that accurately predict which patients would benefit most from chemotherapy. These same signatures also suggest that many of the ovarian and liver cancer patients studied would benefit from combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Dr. Okimoto plans on analyzing the data for dozens of more cancers.

The liver cancer results were based in part on tissue samples collected locally by the liver cancer working group (TeamLiver), which includes about 15 researchers and physicians from the Cancer Center and local hospitals that make up the Hawaii Cancer Consortium collaborating on liver cancer research for more than 4 years. Hawaii has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation and the second highest liver cancer mortality rate in the U.S.","Pharmaceuticals"

Overweight mice treated with these nanoparticles lost 10% of their body weight over 25 days  without showing any negative side effects.

The drugs work by transforming white adipose tissue, which is made of fat-storing cells, into brown adipose tissue, which burns fat. The drugs also stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in fat tissue, which positively reinforces the nanoparticle targeting and aids in the white-to-brown transformation.

These drugs, which are not FDA approved to treat obesity, are not new, but the research team developed a novel method to deliver them so that they accumulate in fatty tissues, helping to avoid unwanted side effects in other parts of the body.

""The advantage here is now you have a way of targeting it [the drug] to a particular area and not giving the body systemic effects. You can get the positive effects that you'd want in terms of antiobesity but not the negative ones that sometimes occur,"" says Robert Langer, Sc.D., the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.

Dr. Langer and his colleagues have shown that promoting angiogenesis can help transform adipose tissue and lead to weight loss in mice. However, drugs that promote angiogenesis can be harmful to the rest of the body.

To try to overcome these harmful effects, Dr. Langer and Omid Farokhzad, M.D., director of the Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Biomaterials at Brigham and Women's Hospital, turned to the nanoparticle drug-delivery strategy they have developed in recent years to treat cancer and other diseases. By targeting these particles to the disease site, they say they can deliver a powerful dose while minimizing the drug's accumulation in other areas.

The researchers designed the particles to carry the drugs in their hydrophobic cores, bound to a polymer known as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which is used in many other drug-delivery particles and medical devices. They packaged two different drugs within the particles rosiglitazone, which has been approved to treat diabetes but is not widely used due to adverse side effects, and an analog of prostaglandin. Both drugs activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which stimulates angiogenesis and adipose transformation.

The outer shell of the nanoparticles consists of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer embedded with targeting molecules that guide the particles to the correct destination. These targeting molecules bind to proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels that surround adipose tissue.

The researchers tested the particles in mice that had become obese after being fed a high-fat diet. The mice lost about 10% of their body weight, and their levels of cholesterol and triglycerides  also dropped. The mice also became more sensitive to insulin. (Obesity often leads to insulin insensitivity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes). The mice did not show any side effects from the treatment, which was delivered every other day for 25 days.

With the current system, the particles are injected intravenously, which could make this approach suitable for morbidly obese patients who are at significant risk of obesity-related diseases, says Dr. Farokhzad. ""For it to be more broadly applicable for treatment of obesity, we have to come up with easier ways to administer these targeted nanoparticles, such as orally,"" he says.

The challenge to delivering nanoparticles orally is that it is difficult for them to penetrate the lining of the intestines. In a previous study, however, Drs. Langer and Farokhzad developed a nanoparticle coated with antibodies that bind to receptors found on surfaces of cells lining the intestine, allowing the nanoparticles to be absorbed through the digestive tract. More recently, Dr. Farokhzad and colleagues have developed another orally delivered nanoparticle that uses transferrin, a protein involved in the transport of iron in the body, to facilitate active transport of nanoparticles across the intestine.

The researchers also hope to find more specific adipose tissue targets for the nanoparticles, which could further reduce the possibility of side effects, and they may also investigate using other drugs with lower toxicity.","Pharmaceuticals"

SELECT-1 was an international trial with 510 randomized patients in over 200 centers. Patients received either selumetinib (75 mg, orally, twice daily) or placebo in combination with docetaxel (intravenously, 75 mg/m2, on day one of every 21-day cycle).

Bohen added that AstraZeneca expects to present data from SELECT-1 at a forthcoming medical meeting, adding:  We remain committed to further developing treatments in the lung cancer setting, such as our immunotherapy combinations and targeted EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor] treatments. 

SELECT-1 represents selumetinib s second Phase III failure in as many years. In July 2015, AstraZeneca said the candidate did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in the Phase III SUMIT study assessing selumetinib with dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

Selumetinib (also known as AZD6244 and ARRY-142886) is an inhibitor of MEK  , a critical component of the RAS-ERK pathway, activation of which is implicated in driving cancer growth and progression, including in patients with KRASm NSCLC.

Selumetinib is also under study for adjuvant treatment of patients with stage III or IV differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), for which the treatment received the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation in May, and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

AstraZeneca said it remained committed to developing selumetinib, including in Phase III trials in patients with DTC, and in a U.S. National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase II registration trial in pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1 patients.

AstraZeneca acquired exclusive worldwide rights to selumetinib from Array BioPharma in 2003 in return for the pharma giant agreeing to pay Array $10 million upfront, research funding, potential development milestones of over $85 million, depending upon the number of successfully commercialized products, and royalties on product sales.","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, among these diseases, there are a few that are isolated to much smaller regions and populations, causing them to be often overlooked during drug development.

Now scientists at the Wellcome Trust, Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), University of York, University of Washington, and the University of Glasgow have identified a chemical that can cure three of these neglected diseases in mice Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Additionally, the newly developed compound does not harm human cells in laboratory tests, providing a strong starting point for drug development.

""We found that these parasites harbor a common weakness,  explained senior study author Frantisek Supek, Ph.D., research investigator at GNF.  We hope to exploit this weakness to discover and develop a single class of drugs for all three diseases.""

Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis affect 20 million people worldwide and lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually. These eukaryotic parasites commonly referred to as kinetoplastids  share similar biology and genetics, which led the researchers to think it possible to find a single chemical that could destroy all three. The research team uncovered an enzyme common to all three parasites and developed a chemical that binds to the ""target,"" preventing it from functioning.

As part of the research, three million compounds held in the Novartis chemical library were tested by a phenotypic screen against live parasites and the most active were then modified over 3000 times using synthetic chemistry before the most potent one was identified  a compound called GNF6702.

""It's a breakthrough in our understanding of the parasites that cause the three diseases, potentially allowing them to be cured,  noted co-author Jeremy Mottram, Ph.D., chair in pathogen biology at the Centre for Immunology and Infection within the University of York. ""This early-phase drug discovery project will now move toward toxicity testing prior to human trials.""

The findings from this study were published recently in Nature in an article entitled  Proteasome Inhibition for Treatment of Leishmaniasis, Chagas Disease, and Sleeping Sickness. 

Much of the research was performed using in vivo imaging technology and initially focused on human African trypanosomiasis, a disease found in sub-Saharan Africa and transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease gets its more common name from the disturbance of the sleep cycle caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei infecting the brain, causing victims to fall into a coma and die.

Finding a drug that can target the disease in the brain has always been a challenge for scientists, but the research team believes they have made a breakthrough using an animal model of the human disease.

""We were able to detect the parasite in the brain using an imaging system that detects the presence of genetically modified light-emitting parasites,  remarked co-author Elmarie Myburgh, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the department of biology at the University of York. ""We then tested the chemical developed by Novartis using our imaging method, which showed that it could get into the brain and kill the parasites.""

""It is a great example of collaboration between industry and academic partners,  Dr. Myburgh added.  By combining resources and expertise, you can really make significant scientific progress.""

Existing treatments for the three diseases are expensive, often have side effects, and are not very effective. The fact that GNF6702 does not seem to have any adverse effects in mice suggests that it might have fewer side effects than existing drugs, although this will need to be explored in human studies. GNF6702 is now being tested for toxicity before it can be moved into clinical trials.

""These three diseases lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually, yet they receive relatively little funding for research and drug development,  stated Stephen Caddick, Ph.D., director of innovation at the Wellcome Trust.  We hope that our early-stage support for this research will provide a basis for the development of new treatments that could reduce suffering for millions of people in the poorest regions of the world.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The new find comes from an international team of scientists. In collaboration with Jordi Solana and Nikolaus Rajewsky and other colleagues from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) in Germany and the University of Toronto, Manuel Irimia, a group leader at the Center for Genomic Regulation, examined the shifting patterns of gene activity in stem cells in planarians and reported their results in the journal eLife. Their paper, entitled,  Conserved Functional Antagonism of CELF and MBNL Proteins Controls Stem Cell-Specific Alternative Splicing in Planarians,  appeared August 9.

The scientists noted how curious it is that a stem-cell-specific AS mechanism should be shared across such a wide evolutionary range. The scientists suggested that the mechanism must be very ancient, and that it may be equally important as transcription factors are for giving animal stem cells their unique properties.

 We studied AS in a powerful in vivo model for stem cell biology, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea,"" wrote the article s authors. ""We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. 

The researchers identified splicing processes that operate only in the stem cells of the worms, and identified numerous alternative exons responsible for stem-cell-specific protein variants. Surprisingly, introns were often not removed from the RNA, which meant that no more functioning proteins could be generated. The researchers also found small exon snippets, ""micro exons,"" in fully developed cells.

In subsequent experiments, the scientists switched off the proteins that control AS. One of these proteins is MBNL, which suppresses the production of stem-cell-specific protein variants. They also discovered that the CELF protein counteracts MBNL by stimulating the production of these variants. During development from a stem cell to a tissue cell, the two factors competed for predominance. This interaction between MBNL and CELF has been previously described only in mammalian cells.

""In our study we identified new mechanisms that we weren't aware of from the usual studies into mammalian stem cells. With this knowledge, it's now possible for us to look in a targeted manner for the same processes in human cells,"" said Solana.

""I found it particularly fascinating that it's impossible to understand how MBNL without knowing about the function of CELF,  observed group leader Prof. Nikolaus Rajewsky, who is an expert on the systems biology of RNA.  Maybe other splicing factors compete or cooperate in a similar way.""

The scientists' work also raises fundamental questions about the function of stem cells in animals. ""To find the antagonism between MBNL and CELF in flatworms is interesting from an evolutionary biologist's perspective,  noted Solana.  For the first time, we described mechanisms in stem cells in organisms from extremely distant branches of the evolutionary tree. What we found is probably a fundamental process throughout the animal kingdom.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Pharming reasons that it can enter another $700 million market if it can win approval for an additional indication. On July 18, Pharming trumpeted positive results in a Phase II trial of Ruconest for prophylaxis of HAE, with the drug meeting its primary endpoints for both once-weekly and twice-weekly dosing regimens.

Pharming agreed to pay Valeant $60 million upfront upon closing of the deal, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, and up to $65 million in potential payments tied to achieving sales milestones.

The acquisition will be funded through a combination of straight debt and new equity capital of between $80 million and $100 million, the buyer added.

Pharming said it expects Valeant s 11-member Ruconest sales force will join the buyer and continue selling the drug in the U.S. That sales force will be increased, the company said, with Pharming also planning to spend more on medical science liaison personnel and additional marketing activities, including patient advocacy programs and  significant  unconditional support for the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association, its programs, and other HAE centers of excellence in the U.S.

Also planned, Pharming added, is additional spending to make Ruconest available in Canada and Mexico, as well as generating more sales in the E.U., Middle East, and Africa markets that Pharming will take over from Sobi in October.

The deal has already completed prenotification and clearance procedures under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act 1976, Pharming said.

Pharming said it anticipates that the deal will add to its 2016 earnings, and enable the company to reach profitability as much as 3 years earlier than under the license with Valeant.

Valeant acquired North American rights to Ruconest when it acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals last year, in a deal completed April 1, 2015.

""This work was done in collaboration with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and is an excellent example of how animal disease research can be leveraged to benefit human health,"" commented Heather West Greenlee, Ph.D., an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine. ""It provides important insights into the timeline for key pathologic milestones of prion disease in the retina and a model to study mechanisms of disease progression and evaluate therapeutic interventions.""

The study used an experimental mouse model of the prion disease scrapie to determine the temporal relationship between the transport of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) from the brain to the retina, the accumulation of PrPSc in the retina, the inflammatory response of the surrounding retinal tissue, and the loss of neurons.

It is believed that transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) progression depends on the spread of misfolded protein from one central nervous system structure to another. The investigators injected mouse-adapted scrapie into the brains of mice and studied the movement of misfolded prion protein from the brain into the retina via the optic nerve for up to 153 days postinoculation (dpi), when clinical disease becomes apparent.

By studying prion disease in the retina, which is relatively isolated from the brain, researchers were able to determine the time lag between stages of the disease process and to detect seeding of misfolded protein sequentially in the retina at 60 dpi, followed by accumulation of PrPSc and activation of retinal glia at 90 days, activation of microglia at 105 dpi, and retinal neuronal death at 120 dpi.

Prion diseases, also known as TSEs, are a transmissible protein misfolding disease, which makes them a good model to study common aspects of these diseases. ""Not only will this work contribute to the development of therapy to treat prion disease, but it may also provide important insights into which therapies may be effectively applied to the treatment of other protein misfolding diseases, including Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease,"" explained Dr. Greenlee.

Using this information, it is now possible to evaluate a potential therapy for its ability to interfere with accumulation of protein misfolding, to suppress damaging neuroinflammation, or to prevent death of neurons, she added.

Prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, mad cow disease in cows, and chronic wasting disease in deer.","Pharmaceuticals"

Such message control may well have its uses in sustaining health or yielding to illness, which is why it attracted the interest of scientists based at Duke University. Specifically, these scientists decided to study G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that seemed to counter foundational assumptions about cell signaling.

Classically, it was known that GPCRs located along the plasma membrane inside the cell activate G proteins, which are the molecular switches that transmit signals from external sources into the cell's interior, telling the cell how to function.

The activation process is followed by desensitization, led by a protein called  -arrestin that binds to the receptor, blocking further activation of G proteins and pulling the receptor to the inside of the cell in a process termed internalization or endocytosis. The end result of these two processes is to silence receptor signaling, allowing cellular function to return to baseline.

In recent years, however, scientists learned that some GPCRs continue to signal to G proteins, even after  -arrestin has been deployed and the receptors were internalized in the cellular compartments, called endosomes. These observations challenged the existing understanding of how GPCR signaling works.

In hopes of resolving this quirk of cell signaling, the Duke scientists employed a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based methods in a new study of GPCRs. Ultimately, these scientists, led by Robert Lefkowitz, M.D., a professor at Duke and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, uncovered the existence, functionality, and architecture of previously unknown superstructures of receptors, which they've called supercomplexes or ""megaplexes.""

Details of this work appeared August 4 in the journal Cell, in an article entitled,  GPCR-G Protein- -Arrestin Super-Complex Mediates Sustained G Protein Signaling. 

 These super-complexes or 'megaplexes' more readily form at receptors that interact strongly with  -arrestins via a C-terminal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine phosphorylation sites,  wrote the article s authors.  Single-particle electron microscopy analysis of negative-stained purified megaplexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously binds through its core region with G protein and through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with  -arrestin. 

The megaplexes differ from the typical couplings of the receptors and  -arrestin, binding simultaneously through their core region with G protein and through a tail region with  -arrestin. Because  -arrestin interacts only with the receptor tail, the entire inner surface of the receptor is exposed, enabling the receptor to keep activating the G protein.

""The formation of such megaplexes explains how G proteins can continue to send signals after being internalized by GPCRs,"" said Dr. Lefkowitz. ""This opens a whole world of possibilities yet to be explored to manipulate this duality of signaling from outside and inside the cell for therapeutic benefit.""

Co-lead author Alex R.B. Thomsen added that some previous studies showed that the cells respond differently when G protein signaling occurs from different cellular compartments.

""As a result, pharmaceutical drugs developed in the future, if they are capable of regulating signaling at specific compartments, might be able to better treat certain diseases while having fewer side effects,"" Dr. Thomsen noted. Such research is in its infancy, however, and clinical applications are years away.","Pharmaceuticals"

Inflammation symptoms such as joint stiffness for sufferers from inflammatory arthritis are generally worse during waking hours. Now, a new study from investigators at the University of Manchester in the U.K. is seeking to find the connection between the circadian clock and various inflammatory pathways.

The British researchers discovered that a protein created by the body's ""biological clock"" called CRYPTOCHROME actively represses inflammatory pathways within affected limbs during the night. Previous research on this protein has described its anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and could represent potential new opportunities for the development of drugs that may be used to treat inflammatory diseases and conditions, such as arthritis.

""By understanding how the biological clock regulates inflammation, we can begin to develop new treatments, which might exploit this knowledge,"" explained senior study author Julie Gibbs, Ph.D., lecturer at the Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Institute of Human Development within the University of Manchester. ""Furthermore, by adapting the time of day at which current drug therapies are administered, we may be able to make them more effective.""

The research team harvested cells from joint tissue of healthy mice and humans. These cells, called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), are important in the pathology that underlies inflammatory arthritis. Each of these cells keeps a 24-hour rhythm, and when this rhythm was disrupted by knocking out the cryptochrome gene there was an increased inflammatory response

 To investigate mechanistic links between the biological clock and pathways underlying inflammatory arthritis, mice were administered collagen (or saline as a control) to induce arthritis,  the authors wrote.  The treatment provoked an inflammatory response within the limbs, which showed robust daily variation in paw swelling and inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory markers were significantly repressed during the dark phase. 

The findings from this study were published recently in The FASEB Journal in an article entitled  The Circadian Clock Regulates Inflammatory Arthritis. 

The scientists  data suggested that the cryptochrome gene product, the CRYPTOCHROME protein, had significant anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, the research team was interested in testing this hypothesis, so they administered drugs designed to activate the protein to determine if protection against inflammation could be achieved which proved successful.

 The results show that the core clock proteins CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 repressed inflammation within the FLSs, and provide novel evidence that a CRYPTOCHROME activator has anti-inflammatory properties in human cells,  the authors penned.  We conclude that under chronic inflammatory conditions, the clock actively represses inflammatory pathways during the dark phase. This interaction has exciting potential as a therapeutic avenue for treatment of inflammatory disease. 

""This study reminds us that inflammation, typically thought of as chronic and brittle, can, in fact, be nuanced In this case, under the influence of the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, which controls the body's circadian physiology,"" noted Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., editor-in-chief of The FASEB Journal.

However, mechanistically, there s no direct evidence to show how this system affects behavior. 

In this study, Dr. Xu and colleagues identified a neural circuit in which a group of serotonin neurons project to and activate dopamine neurons. They showed that activation of this circuit can inhibit binge-like eating behavior in mice.

In addition, because there are 14 potential receptors that can mediate complex effects of serotonin in the body, Dr. Xu s team identified a specific receptor that is important in binge-like eating behavior. They determined that the serotonin 2C receptor, which is expressed by dopamine neurons, is important in suppressing binge eating.

Dr. Xu noted that an FDA-approved drug, a serotonin 2C agonist, is currently being used as a treatment for overweight and obese adults and could potentially be repurposed to suppress binge eating in adults.","Pharmaceuticals"

This is true for infants born as early as 24 weeks gestation, say the scientists.

 

 How microbes get into the airways and the purpose of this prebirth colonization are still unclear, but the pattern of colonization appears to have an important link to later severe neonatal lung disease.

 

 An early microbial imbalance, or dysbiosis, is predictive for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity. The extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants in this study had an average birth weight of 1 pound, 8 ounces. Researchers found that the ELBW infants who went on to develop life-threatening BPD showed abnormal microbial colonization patterns at birth, as compared to preterm infants who did not get BPD.

 

 ""Right at birth, your respiratory microbiome can possibly predict your risk for BPD,"" said Charitharth Vivek Lal, M.D., assistant professor in the UAB Pediatrics Division of Neonatology and the lead investigator of this study.

 

 The study also suggests that the ""healthy"" pattern of colonization seen in the BPD-resistant ELBW infants, with increased abundance of Lactobacillus, is protective.

 

 ""We speculate that the early airway microbiome may prime the developing pulmonary immune system, and dysbiosis in its development may set the stage for subsequent lung disease,"" the researchers say in their paper (""The Airway Microbiome at Birth"") in Scientific Reports. ""Should a disordered airway microbiome prove to be involved in the pathogenesis of disease, it will be of immediate interest to attempt to develop novel therapeutic interventions.""

 

 Dr. Lal says this is the first unbiased airway microbiome analysis to be done immediately at birth (all the early saline aspirates from the tracheas of the newborns were collected at or within 6 hours of delivery).

 

 It is also the only infant airway microbiome analysis to be validated at a second medical center. After the first group of 23 ELBW infants and 10 full-term infants were studied at the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, UAB Women & Infants Center, samples from a second group of 14 ELBW infants were studied in collaboration with Vineet Bhandari, M.D., at Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia.

 

 About half of the ELBW infants at both sites, all of them extremely preterm, later developed BPD. The differences in the microbiomes between infants who were BPD-resistant and BPD-predisposed were similar for infants in both Birmingham and Philadelphia.

 

 Extremely premature infants are at risk for BPD, which is the most common lung pathology of these tiny infants and a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Adults and children who had BPD as infants have lungs that failed to develop properly and are more prone to worse lung function, asthma, lung infections, and pulmonary hypertension.

 

 The researchers also looked at the airway microbiomes of 18 ELBW infants with established BPD and found that their microbiomes had a decreased diversity of types of microbes. The pattern was very different from those of ELBW infants shortly after birth or full-term infants at birth.

 

 As to specific groups of microbes, the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes bacteria like Escherichia coli, appeared to be involved in BPD pathology, and the genus Lactobaccillus, part of the phylum Firmicutes, appeared to be involved in disease protection.

 

 Dr. Lal and colleagues found decreased Lactobacillus abundance in the airway microbiomes of 10 infants born to mothers who had chorioamnionitis, an infection of the membranes of the placenta and an independent risk factor for BPD, as well as decreased Lactobacillus abundance at birth in the airways of the BPD-predisposed ELBW infants as compared to BPD-resistant infants. Research elsewhere has suggested a beneficial role for Lactobacillus against airway diseases and for lung development.

 

 ""I predict that researchers will study the use of respiratory probiotics, and the role of the gut lung microbiome axis in the future,"" Dr. Lal said.

 

 For five ELBW infants who later developed BPD, the researchers collected periodic airway microbiome samples from birth through 9 weeks and saw extremely similar patterns of change in the microbiomes over time.

 

 As for the source of the microbes, Dr. Lal and colleagues wrote, ""As it is commonly believed that colonization of neonates originates in the birth canal, we were surprised to find that the airway microbiomes of vaginally delivered and caesarean section-delivered neonates were similar, which suggests that the microbial DNA in the airways is probably transplacentally derived, consistent with reports that the placenta has a rich microbiome.""

The researchers speculate that this transmission of bacteria or bacterial DNA to the in utero infant could be via blood or amniotic fluid.","Pharmaceuticals"

MD-72 was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating flexible doses of cariprazine (1.5 4.5 mg) conducted at numerous U.S. sites.

Cariprazine is an oral, once-daily, atypical antipsychotic marketed in the U.S. as Vraylar  for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia in adults, having won FDA approval in September 2015.

Allergan and Richter said they remain committed to developing cariprazine as a potential treatment option for patients suffering from MDD, adding that they will continue to work on another Phase III trial.

The companies have started enrolling patients for a pivotal study assessing cariprazine as a treatment for bipolar depression, an indication for which positive data was published from a Phase IIb trial last year in the Journal of American Psychiatry. Two parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 sites across the U.S. and Europe.

Also last year, the companies announced positive Phase III trial results for cariprazine in the prevention of relapse of schizophrenia symptoms in adults, and Richter separately disclosed positive results from a Phase III study evaluating cariprazine for predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

MD-72 was one of more than 20 trials conducted over the past decade to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cariprazine on thousands of patients in a broad range of mental health illnesses, Allergan and Richter said.

 We are disappointed with the results of this trial,  Allergan Chief R&D Officer David Nicholson said of MD-72 in a statement.  However, we believe that our plan to move forward with another Phase III study in adjunctive MDD coupled with our previous positive clinical trial would provide the two studies needed for submission.

"Stem Cell Factor Puts Differentiation on Speed Dial"," 
	Stem cells can customize their responses to external cues, effectively priming themselves to differentiate toward one cell fate or another.

Stem cells don t come with a speed-dial instruction manual, so scientists based at Stanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SPB) have been working to hack the code. In fact, these scientists have already discovered that OCT4, a stem cell-specific transcription factor, can narrow the range of cell types that stem cells can become.

This finding appeared August 4 in the journal Molecular Cell, in an article entitled,  OCT4 Acts as an Integrator of Pluripotency and Signal-Induced Differentiation.  The article described how the SPB team used genomic approaches along with loss- and gain-of-function genetic models to  uncover OCT4 as an integral and necessary component of signal-regulated transcriptional processes required for tissue-specific responses. 

 OCT4 binds a large set of low-accessible genomic regions,  wrote the article s authors.  At these sites, OCT4 is required for proper enhancer and gene activation by recruiting co-regulators and RAR:RXR [retinoic acid receptor:retinoid X receptor heterodimer] or  -catenin, suggesting an unexpected collaboration between the lineage-determining transcription factor and these differentiation-initiating, signal-dependent transcription factors. 

The SPB scientists also tested the idea that OCT4 can reprogram a cell-type-specific signal response. They demonstrated that overexpression of OCT4 in a kidney cell line is sufficient for signal-dependent activation of otherwise unresponsive genes in these cells.

""We found that the stem-cell-specific protein OCT4 primes certain genes that, when activated, cause the cell to differentiate, or become more specialized,"" said Laszlo Nagy, M.D., Ph.D., a professor at SPB and the senior author of the current study. ""This priming customizes stem cells' responses to signals that induce differentiation and makes the underlying genetic process more efficient.""

Essentially, the new study shows that, at certain genes, OCT4 can collaborate with transcription factors that are activated by external signals, such as the retinoic acid (vitamin A) receptor and  -catenin, to turn on their respective genes. Vitamin A converts stem cells to neuronal precursors, and activation of  -catenin by Wnt can either support pluripotency or promote nonneural differentiation, depending on what other signals are present. Recruitment of these factors  primes  a subset of the genes that the signal-responsive factors can activate.

""Our findings suggest a general principle for how the same differentiation signal induces distinct transitions in various types of cells,"" explained Dr. Nagy. ""Whereas in stem cells, OCT4 recruits the RAR to neuronal genes, in bone marrow cells, another transcription factor would recruit RAR to genes for the granulocyte program. Which factors determine the effects of differentiation signals in bone marrow cells and other cell types remain to be determined.""

""In a sense, we've found the code for stem cells that links the input signals like vitamin A and Wnt to the output cell type,"" continued Dr. Nagy. ""Now we plan to explore whether other transcription factors behave similarly to OCT4 that is, to find the code in more mature cell types.

""If other factors also have this dual function both maintaining the current state and priming certain genes to respond to external signals that would answer a key question in developmental biology and advance the field of stem cell research.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Because this year s games have already been marred by reports of widespread doping, the focus on natural products that could assist athletic programs is even greater.

Now, a new study led by researchers at Northumbria University in the U.K. describes how Montmorency tart cherry juice could be a promising new recovery aid for soccer players following a game or intense practice. The small, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate supported recovery among semiprofessional male soccer players following a test that simulated the physical and metabolic demands of a soccer game.

""Previous research on Montmorency tart cherry juice has examined recovery following muscle-damaging protocols such as heavy weight training, long-distance running, or cycling, but there are no studies that have used sport-specific activity to cause the exercise stress,"" explained senior study author Glyn Howatson, Ph.D., professor of human & applied physiology at Northumbria University. ""This is surprising given that many teams in professional and international soccer and rugby already use Montmorency tart cherry juice to aid recovery.""

The new study involved 16 semiprofessional male soccer players aged 21 to 29 who were randomly assigned to either a Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (MC) group or a placebo control group. Montmorency group participants consumed about 1 ounce (30 mL) of a commercially available Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate mixed with 100 mL of water twice per day (8 a.m. and 6 p.m.) for 7 consecutive days  for 4 days prior to the simulated trial and for 3 days after the trial. Following the same schedule, placebo group participants consumed a calorie-matched fruit cordial with less than 5% fruit mixed with water and maltodextrin. The 30-mL dosage of Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate contained a total anthocyanin content of 73.5 mg or the equivalent of about 90 whole Montmorency tart cherries.

The findings from this study were published recently in Nutrients in an article entitled  The Effects of Montmorency Tart Cherry Concentrate Supplementation on Recovery Following Prolonged, Intermittent Exercise. 

When compared to placebo, MC was found to maintain greater functional performance, impact a key marker of inflammation, and decrease self-reported muscle soreness among study participants following prolonged activity that mirrors the demands of field-based sports.

Additionally, across every performance measure, including maximal voluntary isometric contraction, countermovement jump height, 20-meter sprint time, knee extensors, and 5-0-5 agility, the MC group showed better performance than the placebo group. Moreover, the MC group showed significantly lower levels of interleukin-6, a marker for inflammation, particularly immediately after the trial. Ratings for muscle soreness [delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)] were considerably lower in the Montmorency group across the 72-hour posttrial period.

 These findings suggest MC is efficacious in accelerating recovery following prolonged, repeat sprint activity, such as soccer and rugby, and lends further evidence that polyphenol-rich foods like MC are effective in accelerating recovery following various types of strenuous exercise,  the authors concluded.","Pharmaceuticals"

The trial randomized 541 patients to receive either Opdivo 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks or any of three chemotherapy options (gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine with carboplatin/paclitaxel with carboplatin) and nonsquamous patients (pemetrexed with cisplatin/pemetrexed with carboplatin) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of six cycles.

News of the trial failure sparked a selloff in BMS shares, with the company s share price tumbling 18%, from $75.32 at the close of trading yesterday to $61.76 in premarket trading as of 9:19 a.m.

According to BMS, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 18,000 patients.

Opdivo was the first programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014 and now has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.

In the U.S., Opdivo is approved in combination with BMS  marketed cancer drug Yervoy  (ipilimumab) for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and as a single agent for five indications related to BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).","Pharmaceuticals"
"NIH Issues Proposal on Using Animal Embryos Containing Human Cells"," 
	A growing number of scientists have expressed interest in growing human tissues and organs in animals by introducing pluripotent human cells into early animal embryos. Formation of these types of human&ndash;animal chimeras holds tremendous potential for disease modeling, drug testing, and perhaps eventual organ transplant, say researchers. But uncertainty about the effects of human cells on off-target organs and tissues in the chimeric animals, particularly in the nervous system, raises ethical and animal welfare concerns. 
 
	In 2009 the NIH issued guidelines for human stem-cell research that specifically prohibit introducing human pluripotent cells into nonhuman primate blastocysts and the breeding of animals into which human pluripotent cells may have contributed to the germ line. Given the direction of the science, however, NIH felt that it was an appropriate time to consider whether further policy provisions regarding other chimera models were needed before making funding decisions. ","http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nih-issues-proposal-on-using-animal-embryos-containing-human-cells/81253054/","NA","NA","NIH Issues Proposal on Using Animal Embryos Containing Human Cells | News HighlightsNIH wants public comment on the proposed scope of the chimera research to be considered by the NIH steering committee. The committee will focus on the experimental design and likely nature of the chimeric animal model. The committee s work will be independent of the peer review process. This committee will also monitor new developments in this field and provide analysis and advice to NIH leadership as needed.

NIH is also seeking comment on modifications to the NIH Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research where the agency proposes to expand slightly the current prohibition on the introduction of human pluripotent cells into nonhuman primate embryos to include the preblastocyst stage, and to clarify that NIH will not fund research involving the breeding of animals where the introduction of any type of human cell may result in human egg or sperm development.

NIH officials say these actions are consistent with recently updated guidelines from the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), which suggest that a specialized review of certain types of chimera research is appropriate. The ISSCR guidelines also contain useful suggestions of best practices for experimental design, which the research community is encouraged to consider, according to an NIH spokesperson.

Public comments regarding the NIH proposal can be made at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=57.","Pharmaceuticals"

","http://www.fooddive.com/news/hains-stock-plunges-after-announcing-delay-for-q4-fiscal-2016-earnings/424541/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:49:42 -0400","NA","Hain's stock plunges after announcing delay for Q4, fiscal 2016 earningsThis is a major turn of events for Hain, which up until Monday's afternoon announcement was a focal point of industry takeover speculation. Hain's stock soared after Danone announced it would acquire WhiteWave, a key competitor for Hain in the natural and organic space. Analysts believed Hain would be the next big purchase as the industry continues to consolidate.

Now some analysts are changing their stances and dropping their theses that Hain is still an acquisition target. While Hain's status is questionable, it could be premature to discredit Hain's potential takeover entirely. Before the board's audit committee completes its investigation, it's impossible to know just how much these accounting discrepancies could impact Hain's total revenue for the year.

Hain's revenue would have to fall significantly due for it to be on par with the declines other major manufacturers have reported recently. That includes manufacturers that could purchase Hain, such as General Mills, which reported a 6% decline in net sales for the past fiscal year.

Hain posted a 13% increase in fiscal third-quarter sales, returning to double-digit sales growth increases. Previously, two quarters with high single-digit sales increases had broken a 20-quarter streak of double-digit sales growth. Hain had already lowered its expectations for the fiscal year in January.

The company now has to sort out its financial reporting and any errors that could influence those revenue numbers. But whether those discrepancies will be enough to shake the confidence that Hain has a strong portfolio rooted in the fast-growing natural and organic sectors is less likely. It may take longer for a takeover to occur as the dust settles around this most recent announcement, but Hain is still positioned for growth in categories that align with consumers' preferences.

The pumpkin spice onslaught begins.As early as it may seem for fall flavors to be hitting grocery store shelves, Kellogg made a similar announcement about last year's pumpkin spice products, including pumpkin spice-flavored Frosted Mini-Wheats, almost a year ago to the day.

More manufacturers are introducing these pumpkin spice-flavored products because consumers keep buying them. Sales of pumpkin-flavored products increased 11.6% in the year leading up to July 2015, according to Nielsen.

General Mills announced earlier this year that it would debut a pumpkin spice variety of Cheerios for a limited time, which should hit stores this month. Cheerios remains the leading U.S. cereal brand, but sales have declined 18% since 2010. A new flavor could benefit the 75-year-old legacy brand, which saw a slower decline in sales last year after General Mills launched Cheerios with a gluten-free label.

But could a new flavor craze might arise this year that could threaten pumpkin spice's dominance? Manufacturers are using big data to identify the next big flavor trends, such as hot cocoa varieties last holiday season. The brands that determine new flavor trends that will be widespread and long-lasting could lead the industry into unexplored flavor territory and boost sales for ailing brands and product segments.","F&B"
"Daily values and unit changes on the new nutrition facts label"," Stay updated on how nutrient values are changing on the new nutrition facts label.&nbsp; ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/daily-values-and-unit-changes-on-the-new-nutrition-facts-label/424301/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:00:00 -0400","NA","Daily values and unit changes on the new nutrition facts labelDaily values and unit changes on the new nutrition facts label

Daily values are recommended levels of intake for each nutrient. It is the number that shows the daily requirement for each nutrient. Daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet. The daily value is used to calculate the percent daily value. The daily value is not seen on the Nutrition Facts Label, but is instead reported as a percent daily value.

Percent daily values are based on daily values and give a general idea of how nutrients in the food fit in the overall diet. Percent daily values allows consumers to easily calculate how much of each nutrient is required. The goal is to meet or not go above 100% of the DV for each nutrient per day(1).

Most of these changes have occurred because of the dietary related diseases that are common in the United States. Below are some of the nutrients that have daily value changes.

There are no longer International Units (IU) for vitamin A, D, and E. These will be replaced with mcg and mg. Institute of Medicine (IOM) Labeling Committee recommended this change in order to be consistent with the new Dietary Reference Intake reports. There is also strong scientific evidence that support these changes

The change in daily values and units might seem minor to the public, which is why it has gone unnoticed when the changes to the nutrition facts label were released. Most consumers will not even realize this minor change in numbers and units on the nutrition facts label. A major concern is that the change in daily values will affect the ability of the manufacturer to make nutrient claims. In order to be a considered  good source,  the product needs to contain 10-19 % DV of that nutrient. If a food is 5% or less of a nutrient, it is considered  low  in that nutrient.  And, if the food has 20% or more, the product it is considered  high  in that nutrient. Now that the daily values are changing, some products might not be eligible to be labeled a  good ,  low , or  high  source. When daily values increase, the percent daily value will decrease on the original product. And when daily values decrease, using sodium as an example, the claim for a product that is originally  low sodium  might not be considered  low  anymore. Companies will need to either remove the claim from their packaging or reformulate the product to appeal to the customers looking for a healthier choice. (4)

Education is key to inform consumers of these changes. Educational campaigns can help consumers better understand the changes to the nutrition facts label and how to use it to encourage overall health and make healthy choices while grocery shopping.","F&B"

But the complexity of meat color comes from a wide range of factors, including ""animal conditions such as age, nutrition and metabolic state; muscle type; presence of nitrogenous compounds, for example nitrate or nitrite; packaging environment; ingredients; and pH,"" Ron Jenkins, commercial development manager of meat, poultry and seafood at Innophos Inc., told Food Business News.

Manufacturers can turn to certain plant-based ingredients, such as rosemary, green tea, acerola cherry and plum extracts, to devise natural ways to preserve meat color and extend shelf life. These ingredients contain antioxidants and similar compounds that can prevent oxidative breakdown of meat pigments, but they can also affect meat's flavor.

Packaging innovations also present opportunities to preserve meat color and extend shelf life. Modified atmosphere packaging currently leads the global advanced packaging segment with more than 51% of market share.

Manufacturers experimenting with meat color may also consider ingredients and processes they use during processing, such as the phosphates they commonly use to improve juiciness, tenderness and cook yields. Phosphates can alter the color of fresh and cooked meats, particularly if the phosphate has a high pH level. If manufacturers are struggling with meat color, altering the use of these phosphates or finding replacements could be a solution.","F&B"

If consumers are impressed by the product and packaging after receiving it as a gift, they may be more likely to buy the product for themselves or as gifts for other people.

To leverage the full potential of food gifts, manufacturers have to ensure they have an e-commerce strategy in place. Consumers are shopping online more, especially for holiday gifts. If gift-friendly products are only available in stores, manufacturers could be losing out on a significant portion of their potential consumer base.

With the winter holidays just around the corner, manufacturers are likely already considering new product formulations and packaging that could be better suited for food gifting. Last year, Mondelez introduced Oreo Colorfilled and Hershey debuted Hershey's Kisses Deluxe in time for the holidays. Mondelez integrated e-commerce and personalization of the packaging to make its legacy Oreos brand more gift-friendly. Hershey created a new recipe for its iconic Kisses to align with premium chocolate products, which are common food gift items.

Consumer food gifting makes up the bulk of sales, which Packaged Facts expects to increase by 2.5% over last year. Sales for corporate food gifting, though smaller, should increase by 4% due in part to positive employment trends and the expansion of companies and services specializing in corporate food gift baskets. Manufacturers that partner with these companies could have their products featured in corporate gift baskets, either exclusively or with other brands and manufacturers.

Traditional methods like interviews and surveys still play an important role in investigations, but they can be time and labor-intensive and invite opportunity for human error. Big data can make the process faster, easier and more accurate for all parties involved, which could save time and money.

With this algorithm, manufacturers and public health agencies could reduce the time it takes to narrow down a list of potential contamination sources from days or weeks to hours based on as few as 10 medical examination reports for a foodborne illness. Having a more accurate list in a short period of time can give manufacturers more breathing room to plan how best to approach a recall, if necessary, and any changes they need to make to their operations to fix the problem and prevent it from recurring.

The sooner agencies and manufacturers can identify the product and specific lot and batch numbers, the faster they can alert consumers and pull those products   and any other products that use the contaminated product as an ingredient   off the market. Having additional data can also help manufacturers be more transparent about a recall or foodborne illness outbreak linked to their products because they can pass some of that data along to consumers.

Big data could also be critical for cases where investigators could never clearly identify a contamination source, such as the CRF Frozen Foods recall and listeria contamination that impacted more than 350 frozen food products under 42 brand names earlier this year.","F&B"

Now that perceptions of portion sizes and better-for-you ingredients have changed, mini foods have regained their relevancy against a new backdrop of balancing health and cravings.

Manufacturers may not be able to easily associate their legacy products with better-for-you eating. But they can reformulate the product's serving size and packaging to become an appropriately-sized indulgence that fits consumers' pursuit of a healthier lifestyle.

Mini foods can also become a more profitable pricing strategy for manufacturers while they deliver the portion sizes consumers demand. Soda companies have found mini cans to be a profitable packaging innovation in recent years, as manufacturers can charge more per ounce of soda. Consumers appreciate being able to have a smaller can of soda that doesn't have as much sugar because of its smaller single serving size.

Mini foods have also led to innovations like more ""thin"" snacks, such as Mondelez's Oreo Thins and Wheat Thins Even Thinner crackers.

This strategy could lead to partnerships between food and alcoholic beverage brands, in which they feature one another in pairing promotions. It could also be a way to increase engagement by enabling the consumer to have a voice in what food and beverage pairings they enjoy most.

Canadean also recommends manufacturers tap into high-tech innovations like near-field communication (NFC) and augmented reality to use target functionality in their food and alcohol pairing efforts. Diageo's Johnny Walker brand features an intelligent NFC-enabled label that sends food and drink pairing suggestions to consumers' phones.

Alcoholic beverage brands have often been leaders in high-tech marketing promotions, such as virtual reality utilized by brands like Patron tequila or Beam Suntory's Jim Beam. Anheuser-Busch InBev released limited edition bottles of its Oculto tequila-flavored beer that featured illuminated labels using smart label technology and LED lights.

Mergers and acquisitions may have slowed so far in 2016, but experts have confirmed that this doesn't necessarily signal a downturn in activity for the industry. The capital is available, interest rates are low, and multiples, while lower than recent years, are still favorable for sellers.

It's all about who s going to pull the trigger next as industry consolidation and interest in startups continue.

""You're starting to see big companies making big acquisitions   lots of money and all in line with the evolving consumer trends that they need to be focused on,"" said Lou Biscotti, partner and head of the food and beverage practice at WeiserMazars. ""I think it's very healthy for the companies, the economy and the consumer.""

With just over four months left in the year, these four combinations have hit analysts' and Food Dive's radars as potential deals for the future.

Hain Celestial has been at the center of much takeover speculation, particularly since its natural and organic counterpart WhiteWave Foods accepted a $12.5 billion takeover bid from Danone last month. While Hain's potential suitors run the gamut, the most likely suitor may be General Mills, said Biscotti.

In recent years, General Mills has actively pursued integrating better-for-you products into its portfolio. That includes acquisitions like Annie's, startup investments through its 301 Inc. platform and overhauls of its own brands, with moves like removing artificial ingredients from its cereals and revamping its yogurt portfolio.

With Hain as a leader in the natural and organic food and beverage space, its portfolio could fit well into General Mills  plans for the future. Hain s stock may also be undervalued at the moment, Biscotti said. This gives General Mills leeway with offering a multiple that would be affordable while attractive enough to Hain shareholders.

After 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth, Hain s revenue growth lingered in the high single-digits for two quarters earlier this year before hitting 13% again in fiscal Q3 2016. That kind of revenue growth would be more than welcome at General Mills, which reported a 6% sales decline in fiscal 2016 and a 2% dip in fiscal 2015.

In July, Kellogg's stock spiked on speculation of a takeover by Kraft Heinz or Coca-Cola. Though analysts have since dispelled those rumors, a Kraft Heinz-Kellogg takeover may not be so farfetched.

The Kraft Heinz-Kellogg takeover rumor emerged when intrepid watchers tracked private planes from Battle Creek, MI, where Kellogg has its headquarters, to Chicago, where Kraft Heinz has its headquarters. CNBC confirmed at the time that no takeover talks were ongoing.

Kraft Heinz co-owners Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital have not shied away from growth and profitability opportunities, and Kraft Heinz exemplifies the level of profitability these financial giants can achieve in food and beverage. Earlier this month, Kraft Heinz announced it had quadrupled pro forma profits year over year after identifying opportunities for synergies, reducing costs and slashing the size of its workforce.

Since late 2013, Kellogg has embarked on its own aggressive cost-cutting efforts, including zero-based budgeting and Project K. The company has since shut down or announced the closure of several plants with the intent to ""better align our manufacturing assets with marketplace trends and customer requirements,"" Kellogg spokesperson Kris Charles said in a statement earlier this month.

As a result, Kellogg s net income soared 26% and operating profit increased 9.1%, allowing Kellogg to raise its full-year EPS guidance in the most recently reported quarter. That kind of profitability could be tantalizing to 3G and Berkshire.

But profitability aside, Kraft Heinz may see an opportunity in Kellogg's portfolio. Kellogg was already among targets named for potential acquisition by Berkshire and 3G before they announced they would merge Heinz with Kraft in March 2015.

If Kraft Heinz is looking to diversify, Kellogg offers access to a number of categories that Kraft Heinz isn't currently dominant in, such as cereal and snacks. Acquiring Kellogg would make Kraft Heinz more competitive against companies like General Mills, which already has a strong presence in both categories.

In July, ConAgra confirmed it was moving forward with the Lamb Weston spinoff the company first announced last November, despite short-lived speculation in June that Lamb Weston could merge with Post. Also, over the past year, ConAgra has pursued an aggressive overhaul of its business model, ranging from divestments of private-label brands Spicetec and JM Swank to steep job cuts and a new headquarters in Chicago.

""Without Lamb Weston, (does ConAgra) become more of an acquisition candidate at this point? I think so,"" said Biscotti. ""They definitely are making moves possibly to head in that direction.""

Between the Lamb Weston spinoff and the slimmed-down version of ConAgra and its consumer brands, both individual companies could be acquisition targets. Today's more focused ConAgra is a much more attractive target for buyers than when it had a more unwieldy structure just a year or so ago following many years of rapid acquisitive growth.

Kraft Heinz also makes sense here as a possible buyer. ConAgra offers a number of center-store grocery and frozen brands that could expand Kraft Heinz's portfolio. At the same time, ConAgra brands could be synergistic with grocery categories where Kraft Heinz has already established a presence.

Also, neither Kraft Heinz nor ConAgra have made the same level of better-for-you portfolio overhauls compared to companies like General Mills, Campbell and Nestle   and they may not have to.  A study published in BMJ Open earlier this year found that Americans on average still consume about 58% of their total daily calories from ""ultra-processed"" foods, which primarily comprise both companies' portfolios.

""Think about some of (ConAgra's) brands   they re not in line with some of the healthier for you (trends),"" said Biscotti. ""If you think about companies selling off their brands and their divisions, what is the ultimate goal? I think the goal would be to increase profitability and possibly posture themselves for a sale.""

Hershey may have quickly shut down Mondelez s $23 billion takeover offer earlier this year, but that hasn't shut down speculation that the deal could still happen. Mondelez may return with another, potentially more attractive bid.

Also key to the success of a future bid are changes at the Hershey Trust, including settling with the Pennsylvania attorney general last month, which will likely end in a shakeup of the trust's board. The trust controls 81% of Hershey s voting power, so with a new board and a new offer from Mondelez   or any other buyer   a Hershey sale could have a different outcome.

However, the trust isn t the only party involved. The Milton Hershey School is the beneficiary of the Hershey Trust, which could argue that any decision may not be in the institution's best interest. The attorney general, who has oversight powers over the Hershey Trust, can also step in if he or she believes the deal could negatively impact the local economy.

""It's going to be very tough for someone to acquire Hershey based upon the logistics and the ownership structure and everything surrounding the trust,"" said Biscotti. ""That's a company that's definitely ripe for acquisition, but because of the impediments, it's going to very difficult.""

If Mondelez does return with a sweeter offer, and Hershey shareholders consider the bid to be favorable, they could take action, Biscotti said. They could bring a shareholder suit against the company, saying Hershey did not respond appropriately to the bid.

""The amount of complexities here are just tremendous,"" said Biscotti. ""It's a shame because with Mondelez, it would combine (two of the leading) chocolate companies in the world. The unification of the brand would be a very powerful company.""

The USDA made similar purchases of peanuts and chicken leg quarters after export bans following the avian flu outbreak caused poultry prices to drop.

Dairy processors have been able to ride low milk costs to higher profitability in recent quarters. With milk costs threatening to rebound, dairy producers like Dean Foods or even WhiteWave will have to ensure a strong, reliable top-line growth strategy to keep investors happy.

Further downstream, manufacturers may use the cheese glut to their advantage. They can create new products that feature cheese, either as a component or positioned as a healthy snack itself, and enjoy higher margins on these products while the supply is ample and costs are low.

Innovation and disruption in the cheese category could come at a crucial time for major cheese brands. While more competitors, such as artisanal cheese makers, enter the market, the top five global cheese brands   Kraft, Philadelphia, President, Sargento and Galbani   together owned less than 10% of the fragmented global cheese market, according to a 2015 report from Canadean.

Food waste is also a concern when the industry faces a commodity surplus, and dairy farmers have already had to dump millions of pounds of milk. Mulhern positioned his request as a bailout for dairy farmers but also a way the USDA could provide access to dairy products to families and individuals in need, which in turn reduces milk or cheese dumping and food waste.

The research builds on the technical expertise CIGI has developed over the last ten years in collaboration with pulse growers and industry about the functionality and application of pulse flours.

 By working with Warburtons as a commercial partner on this project, there is a direct link to an end-customer.""

Saskatchewan Pulse Growers has offered $1.8m in funding for the project.

Warburtons is contributing $680,000 in support, in addition to funds to purchase a pilot-scale fermentation tank at GIGI, while the governments of Canada and Manitoba are investing $270,000 through the Grain Innovation Hub.

Western Grains Research Foundation and Manitoba Pulse & Soybean Growers have also provided funding of $158,000 and $25,000, respectively.

The three-year project aims to develop a pulse database summarising new and existing information on the compositional, functional and flavour properties of pulses for the food industry; and investigate the effects of pre-milling and post-milling treatments, particle size and storage.

The project also aims to investigate the use of pre-ferment processing on the functionality and end-product quality of doughs containing pulse flours, and explore the development of pulse-based bakery products that meet particular health and nutrition targets.

Database and research findings will be shared with pulse breeders, seed companies, growers and pulse processors, as well as the food industry.

The latest addition to the Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt portfolio has a finer texture, enabling it to stay on foods better and remain more soluble than regular, granulated salt.

Foodservice companies can use it as flake salt when they use a process called  dusting  to apply salt to food.

""This roughness helps it stick better to the surface of fried foods, whereas regular granulated salt is more likely to bounce off foods when it's applied.""

Cargill salt food application specialist Julie Schuette said: ""This roughness helps it stick better to the surface of fried foods, whereas regular granulated salt is more likely to bounce off foods when it's applied. This also helps bring out the full flavor of fried foods.""

Salt used on french fries often becomes an overlooked source of food waste.

Schuette added: ""A huge amount of salt falls to the tray below the fries because a good portion of the salt just doesn't adhere to the fry's surface. These higher falloff rates, usually associated with regular granulated salt, lead to higher product waste and production costs.""

Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt and Diamond Crystal Fine Kosher Salt use a late 19th century evaporation process that creates hollow, multifaceted crystals.

According to Schuette, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt crystals are 'fragile enough to crush between your thumb and index finger, for perfectly controlled seasoning'.

Fine Kosher salt is also quick to dissolve, which enables wet brines to be prepared faster, and dry brines to absorb more quickly.","F&B"

Ardagh originally challenged the students on the packaging design course to create  a futuristic ready-to-heat premium metal packaging concept for food and seafood. One of their designs was a cheese fondue bowl, which was presented to Emmi. In close cooporation with DeDutch, a food packaging and engineering consultant, Ardagh further developed the concept to meet Emmi s requirements.

The product has since been launched at high-end supermarkets in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.

Ardagh Group chief commercial officer, metal Woep M ller said:  We developed this exclusive microwaveable shaped bowl at our R&D centre in Crosmieres, France, with our innovative prototyping and design techniques and utilising our extensive knowledge and experience in lacquering and printing performance.

 Together with Emmi and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, we tested special food safe lacquers to allow the bowl to be heated either in a microwave or a traditional oven, and to be kept at the right temperature above a candle at the table. We added our patented printed Easy Peel aluminium opening solution that gives the consumer an easy and quicker means of opening the bowl. 

The business case for Emmi was clear. Marcel Zbinden, global category head speciality cheese, added:  Convenience and quick preparation have become a more important trend. This concept has it all, and it will delight fondue lovers worldwide. The All In One Fond , with a metal bowl and ready-to-eat cheese fondue made of real Swiss cheeses, has simplified the preparation of this popular dish and is a perfect combination for a quick, easy and delicious cheese fondue at any time.

The unique label shape gives stature and distinction to the brand marque, while the story of the union of Warner Edwards  founders is reflected in the presence of the English lion and Welsh dragon on pack.

The Cold Press No. 1 fully complies with the latest European legislation for hygiene (EHEDG) and safety (CE). With cold pressing technology, both the nutrients and flavour of fresh fruit and vegetables will remain best preserved in the final juice. The Cold Press No.1 squeezes fruit more gently than other juicing methods. Fruit and vegetable juice is extracted without crushing the cells too much or creating undesirable heat, meaning that the machine works with nature rather than working against it.

The equipment is capable of pressing up to 100 litres of juice every hour, is hydraulic manuel operated, constructed from stainless steel materials and designed according to EHEDG and CE guidelines. With optional separate grinder and pump and filler available, the machine comes with three filter bags and one bucket included.

And the shelf life of cold pressed juices can be extended from a few days to a few weeks without the need for heating or high pressure processing, by utilising the PurePulse PEF technology.

All of the new machinery taps into the emerging trend for healthy, natural and delicious cold-pressed juices, Zwolle-based Foodlife said.","F&B"

Glasgow-based R-Biopharm Rh ne has introduced a robust new smart analyser called Rida Cube Scan which, when used in conjunction with enzymatic tests, detects organic acids, sugars and sulphite in wine, which are indicators of a wine s quality.

The test kit portfolio is being marketed to the drinks safety sector at a time when the UK has retained its place as the sixth biggest wine consumer in the world, and amid an anticipating increase in wine consumption worldwide.

R-Biopharm Rh ne product specialist Joanna Wilkie said:  The Rida Cube Scan is a walk-away instrument that allows automated single-testing. The first tests available for use on this system have been specifically developed with the wine industry in mind.

 All data specific for the test are stored on the RFID card, so there is no need to enter any instrument or application settings. Results are calculated automatically, displayed on the screen and can be exported to a personal computer or a laboratory information management system. 

Wilkie added that one of the great attractions of the Rida Cube Scan is its size: though small enough to sit in a desktop, its innovative technology makes precise testing possible and it contains the functionalities of larger laboratory systems.

The plan is to make the system relevant to other food-related industries, such as cereals and feed, carbonated drinks, honey, milk, dairy and fruit juice production.","F&B"

"Young food start-ups in India","Jessica Gay takes a look at four exciting start-ups from India's booming food-tech industry   from apps to coffee concepts.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/four-young-food-start-ups-in-india/","Wed, 14 Oct 2015 08:13:25 +0000","Food","Young food start-ups in IndiaThe food-tech industry in India is booming. With key players such as FoodPanda leading the revolution, India has experienced a huge surge of start-ups bursting to get a piece of the market. Investors are seeing the worth in this boom and are investing heavily in food-tech start-ups, particularly those in the food delivery sector. Earlier this year, a young food delivery start up, Yumist, received $1m from Orios Venture Partners, whilst another, Bueno, received $600k from an undisclosed angel investor.

Despite this boom, we ve decided to explore some of the start-ups trying to do something a little bit different. We ve identified four young start-ups that have identified their own gap in the market and are working hard to build a successful company in India s ever-evolving food and beverage sector.

Based in Bangalore, this start up began whilst its founder, Shubra Acharya, was at university. Her artisan chocolate company allows the customer to customise their own bars, from chocolate type, flavours and toppings   essentially allowing them to play  chocolatier . Gaining a strong following from B2B clients, including those from India s top IT firms and large car showrooms, the start-up has experienced strong growth since launching in 2014. Whilst already achieving a strong presence throughout India, Happiness Bars  next plan is to gain an international audience throughout the B2B sector.

The concept for Dropkaffe came when its founders decided that the standard of office coffee was poor. The four founders came up with a plan to bring great-tasting, freshly brewed coffee to busy office workers, offering them quality, affordability and accessibility. Already live in five locations across Bangalore, the team s plan is to set up six more centres in the area by the end of the year and progress into developing cold beverages. Fulfilling around 300 orders a day, DropKaffe s growth rate means the team is expecting to reach 1,000 orders a day in the next couple of months. Another major focus for the team is packaging. Believing India still lags behind when it comes to packaging, they are working on addressing solutions for issues such as, spillage and insulation.

Inspired by the health and fitness craze in the US, two young sisters started up Yoga Bars in order to bring the  healthy  snack bar craze to India. Seeing a gap in the market for a quality, natural snack, they launched their company in August 2014. Unlike its competitors, Yoga Bars differentiates itself by being 100% natural, without the addition of corn starch, additives or added vitamins. The company is already experiencing a great amount of success and through a mixture of offline stockists and online selling, since starting, its product sales have risen from 2,000 to 20,000!

Unlike its competitors, Quinto is a food app, designed by a team in Maharashtra, which has been developed to suit the evolved restaurant diner. Rather than just helping diners discover new restaurants, Quinto uses a system of crowdsourcing to create a personalised food recommendation engine which helps its users discover the best food options. Each dish has a star rating, and the users are able to make an informed decision on the restaurant or meal based on the rating and feedback. Whilst the app is currently in beta testing mode, the team have high hopes for success since receiving an undisclosed amount of funding from the founder of the restaurant chain Faaso s earlier this year.","F&B"

According to the organisation:  The benefits of glass packaging for health, taste, and quality are endless and, safe to say, timeless. Glass as a packaging material has been used since 1,200 BC and has taken man through the ages. Now, the recipe for glass will join man on to the next frontier, space.

Lunar Mission One has recently launched an ambitious new campaign  Footsteps on the Moon  which aims to put a digital archive containing millions of human footprints on the Moon in 2017. Inspired by Buzz Aldrin s iconic boot print image,  Footsteps on the Moon  is an opportunity for everyone in the world to upload a picture of their own   or someone they love s   footprints, and store it on the Moon for millions of years. Simply take a photo, and upload it for free here: www.lunarmissionone.com/ footsteps.

 The moon belongs to everyone, and every single one of us has the right to make our mark on its surface   digitally of course,  said David Iron, Founder of Lunar Mission One.  It might be your new born baby s feet, your footsteps on the beach during your honeymoon, or you and your best friends  high heels on a night out. Whatever your story is,  Footsteps on the Moon  is all about capturing the moment and adding it to a digital archive of human life. 

 By sending glass to the moon, we are preserving a fundamental piece of human history that has been in use for millennia,  added Michael Delle Selve, senior communications manager for FEVE.

It is the safest packaging material for health, best preserves the quality of food and drink and is 100% indefinitely recyclable, why wouldn t glass be one of mankind s greatest footprints? ","F&B"

"Arla banned from selling skyr in Finland","Arla is no longer allowed to sell dairy products under the name  skyr  in Finland.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/arla-banned-from-selling-skyr-in-finland/","Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:28:27 +0000","Dairy","Arla banned from selling skyr in FinlandArla is no longer allowed to sell dairy products under the name  skyr  in Finland.

The Swedish company has been selling products labelled skyr in Finland for some time, marketing them as  the Icelandic super yogurt . According to the Reykjav k newspaper Morgunbla i , this has frustrated the Icelandic dairy MS Iceland Dairies, which claims exclusive rights to skyr   claiming  skyr  was not a product type but a specific trademark.

Arla was given one week to remove any skyr products from shelves, as Finnish courts ruled that skyr is a trademark owned by MS. According to the court all dairy products sold as skyr in Finland have to be produced by MS, according to an MS recipe. But the product does not have to be manufactured in Iceland.

Before the lawsuit, MS Iceland Dairies produced an advertisement poking fun at Arla s Skyr. In the video, a tub of Arla Skyr is seen struggling to understand Icelandic and mispronouncing the word skyr, while MS Iceland Dairies  product is heard calling it  yogurt posing as skyr .

Despite MS having registered skyr as a trademark in Norway and Finland, it is simply the name of a traditional Icelandic dairy product, similar to yogurt but made with whey. Skyr existed for hundreds of years before MS began marketing it and is manufactured and marketed by other dairies in Iceland. Nor is skyr a registered trademark anywhere other than Finland and Norway   a fact Arla has exploited, capitalising on the success of the popular Icelandic treat and selling it as  Icelandic super yogurt  in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.","F&B"
"Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic bar","Fruit d'Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry's first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/fruit-dor-launches-pro-cran-the-first-cranberry-probiotic-bar/","Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:24:27 +0000","Food","Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic barIn an attempt to showcase the benefits   and product versatility   of Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder, Fruit d Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry s first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.

The bar features Cran Naturelle blended with protein, prebiotics and probiotics for digestive health and overall well-being,  which literally raises the bar for cranberry beyond UTI,  said Stephen Lukawski, director of global sales and development for Fruit d Or.

The Pro Cran probiotic bar was developed as a prototype to showcase the benefits of using Fruit d Or s cranberry seed powder in the food industry. Bars remain a top choice for healthy foods on the go.

The cranberry seed contains a potent oil that is cold-pressed; the  leftover  seed meal is then dried and milled under a proprietary process to maintain the integrity of the cranberry seed with no degradation, Lukawski explained.  After conducting a finger print analysis we were able to determine that the cranberry seed is rich in fibre and contains at least 20% protein. What makes the tasty Pro Cran bar novel is that the prebiotic in the bar is derived from the cranberry seed and the probiotic is a strain called Bacillus coagulans; the cranberry seed powder and Bacillus coagulans is currently marketed as an ingredient called Lacto Cran. 

Lukawski reports that in a probiotic study by Sabinsa Corp. (East Windsor, NJ and Payson, UT) Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder   developed exclusively for food and beverage applications   was compared against FOS (fructooligosaccharides) and inulin. Test results demonstrated that the cranberry seed generated  200% more activity growth for the BC strain over FOS or inulin.

 The cranberry seed acts as a nutritious food for the probiotic strain. It s most likely that the cranberry seed provides a carbon and nitrogen source that fuels the growth of the strain. In addition the cranberry seed contains other important attributes such as 16 essential amino acids, fatty acids and at least 2% PAC content. 

Lukawski notes that he used the Bacillus strain from Sabinsa because of its ability to ensure the cultures survive the baking temperatures needed to produce the Pro Cran bar.  As a result the cultures remain stable and active through to the last bite. 

Each Pro Cran bar delivers 2 billion CFU probiotic cultures, contains 4g of cranberry seed powder and 12 grams of protein. Enjoying two bars daily provides a good source of fibre and protein. The Pro Cran bar is coated in vanilla yogurt and is low in calories and sugar.

Pro Cran was conceived and developed by Lukawski, who has a lengthy list of unique nutra-foods to his credit, including:  antioxidant-rich pretzels, pizza flour and bread; omega 3, 6, 9 pretzels, cranberry protein pretzels, grape skin pretzels and bread, chia fibre pretzels and bread, cranberry protein and fiber bread, cranberry pizza flour, chia seed pizza flour, probiotic/vitamin C/cranberry gum for oral health, PS and cranberry cognitive health bar, and more.

 The philosophy of Pro Cran is very simple:  people prefer foods to pills in order to obtain nutraceutical benefits,  Lukawski comments.  Foods that are tasty, convenient, portable and that provide the specific sought-after health benefits will have sustained high sales velocity. 

Pro Cran is produced by Sunny Crunch Foods Ltd., a certified-organic leading Canadian specialist in private label manufacturing of nutrition bars and granolas. Pro Cran cranberry-probiotic bar is available for private label and is ready to be marketed to the retail industry.","F&B"

	As brands seek to tap into sustainability and wellness trends, brand owners can make significant strides in the arena with clean labels, transparency &ndash; both figuratively and literally &ndash; and by striving to reduce their carbon footprint throughout the supply chain. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89042-setting-good-and-great-brands-apart","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Setting good and great brands apartThe aesthetic appeal of beverage packaging will always be a significant driver of purchase decisions at the point of sale. Along with that, a brand s commitment to sustainability and wellness is an increasingly competitive tool to drive consumer preference. As brands seek to tap into sustainability and wellness trends, brand owners can make significant strides in the arena with clean labels, transparency   both figuratively and literally   and by striving to reduce their carbon footprint throughout the supply chain.

In today s competitive market, communication is essential in order to establish consumer trust. To strengthen brand loyalty and attract consumers at point of sale, brand owners must speak to consumers through easy-to-read labels. Additionally, benefits such as sugar free, organic and non-GMO should be made very clear considering the increasing demand for wholesome products. As shoppers become more interested in knowing how products are manufactured, brands that effectively communicate sustainable business practices and how their ingredients are sourced help cultivate consumer trust.

The demand for nutritious products puts pressure on both brand owners and retailers   which makes communicating benefits more important than ever. For example, the national pharmacy CVS, rebranded to CVS Health in 2014, has seen increasing demand for more health-conscious food and beverage products. After a pilot program in 2015 in which the company offered healthier options in 500 stores throughout the nation, the chain is now expanding the initiative to 2,900 CVS pharmacy locations. The team at CVS also expects to occupy 25% of checkout space   traditionally reserved for products like candy and chocolate bars   with wellness products.

The trend for healthier products presents an excellent opportunity for food and beverage brands. When packaging reflects key benefits consumers are seeking, they can immediately connect with the brand and have a greater chance of choosing that product over an alternative.

A demonstrated concern for the environment is another aspect setting good and great brands apart. This applies to virtually every sector, including the beverage industry. Companies that position their brands as market leaders   and are planning to remain there for the long run   must be proactive in their sustainability efforts.

As part of the Bacardi Limited  Good Spirited: Building a Sustainable Future  environmental initiative, for example, the company promoted its 100% biomass-fueled distillery for its Tequila CAZADORES  in Mexico. Nothing goes to waste in the production process; organic materials, including fibers from the agave used to make the tequila, are converted to biofuel in order to power the distillery. As a result, the distillery reduced noise pollution by 20% and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by more than 80%.

In order to ensure consumer loyalty and longevity for a brand, a team must take the necessary steps to innovate and address challenges that come along with evolving trends. At PACK EXPO International, beverage brand owners will find the latest innovations that address wellness and sustainability. Attendees can expect to see materials that preserve freshness and reduce waste as well as labeling systems that provide greater sustainability and flexibility. The show will feature the latest advancements in robotics and automation as well as advanced technologies for dispensing, filling, cleaning and reducing water usage.

"DSCSA making progress, but toward what?"," 
	As mid-2016 passes by, the pharmaceutical packaging world is surrounded by serialization and DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) activity. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89041-dscsa-making-progress-but-toward-what","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","DSCSA making progress, but toward what?As mid-2016 passes by, the pharmaceutical packaging world is surrounded by serialization and DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) activity. As someone intimately involved in pharmaceutical packaging in practice and teaching, serialization is part of every single day.

At the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council (HCPC), we try to imagine how DSCSA might support safer packaging for consumers. The opportunities are numerous but for the moment everyone is focused on getting the job done. HCPC does note however, that this effort is mute the second we enter pharmacy and begin the antiquated process of repackaging prescriptions into little amber vials which truly unravels the potentially safe supply chain being sought by DSCSA. As well, the process contributes to poor health outcomes, through lack of reminder packaging, and unsafe products, due to exposure to moisture and oxygen post-pharmacy. (The HCPC study on post-pharmacy exposure is available at hcpconline.org.)

At Pester Pac Automation, I see case packer after case packer being readied for serialization as pharma manufacturers and contract packagers scramble to meet looming deadlines. The serialization providers and case packing methods are varied but the end result is the same. A simple process made overly complicated by a procedure which does not integrate well with automated case packing, i.e., line of sight barcode read and capture for bottles and cartons as they are collated and transferred to cases. Thanks to creative engineering, the challenge has been met but the process is less than elegant.

Before we were tasked with barcode serialization, RFID was the likely carrier for serial ID from about 2003 until around 2011. Around that time it was decided that RFID was not mature or robust enough for the task (It was also expensive). Many did not concur with that opinion but the money won the argument. I sincerely believe that those who killed RFID hoped that the complexity and cumbersome nature of line of sight barcode capture would kill any national pedigree legislation. Serialization was undesirable in any fashion; they gambled and they lost. Here we are, saddled with inserting this task into what were formerly efficient packaging processes. This task would have been dramatically less complex with RFID.

The spring of 2016 saw the inaugural graduate pharmaceutical packaging course at Rutgers University. We heard how students new to this world of pharmaceutical packaging would respond to the serialization task. Some were already engaged in the process as entry level employees at pharmaceutical manufacturers. Without exception, they wondered why  we  chose barcode over RFID or some other method that did not hinder the packaging process.

 We  went into the explanation and these grad students began to learn that it is not technology that rules the day, but politics. Even in the world of packaging, special interest groups and the power of politics trump technology. That is why we continue to repack in pharmacy; that is why we still have paper printed outserts; and that is why we are struggling to capture barcode reads instead of RFID. It was a valuable if not humbling lesson for the students, but it will make them better prepared to combat the objections they will encounter.

Better packaging solutions are out there; we need leaders who will look past the bottom line to engage them.

The Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council is a not-for-profit trade association whose mission is to promote the greater use of compliance-prompting packaging to improve patient adherence and patient outcomes, which will lead to reduced healthcare costs. The positive effects of this style of packaging have been proven by numerous studies over the past twenty years, yet U.S. pharmaceutical distribution still clings to an antiquated amber vial for a majority of prescriptions. While advances have been made in every facet of our daily lives, life-saving medication packaging remains in a vial introduced in the 1950s. The HCPC is working to change this.

"The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging line"," 
	When it came time to install a new packaging line, The Wine Group needed a solution that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89039-the-wine-group-incorporates-a-state-of-the-art-packaging-line","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging lineThe Wine Group (TWG) is one of the largest wine producers in the world, distributing more than 60 million cases of wine each year. From its corporate headquarters in Livermore, CA, the company ships out over five million cases of wine annually throughout North America, Western Europe and Asia. Satisfying the palates of wine lovers worldwide involves a sophisticated process. When it came time to install a new packaging line in the Livermore facility, TWG turned to its trusted partner for 15-plus years, Hartness International (hartness.com). With a shared commitment to excellence, Hartness has supplied accumulation and end-of-line packaging equipment in the past for TWG s Ripon and Livermore facilities.

 When we were putting in the new line in Livermore, we were looking for a line that was fully automated, could handle a variety of different sized packages and essentially  do it all ,  says TWG plant manager Ryan Dean.

From screw cap, cork, poly-laminated and PVC capsules, bulk glass and RSC glass, the line needed to handle a variety of customer demands. With the automated line, it was essential for TWG to increase accumulation capacity in order to minimize the effects of occasional micro-stops and downtime. Equally important was the ability for all of the equipment pieces to work together seamlessly.

A solution was needed that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. In the end, TWG opted to incorporate a DYNAC accumulation machine, case packer and laner from Hartness.

There were several components to this solution, but accumulation was the key. The Wine Group already had installed Hartness  DYNAC accumulation system and a top-load case packer and high-speed laner in other areas of its facility, and the company knew that these would integrate well together on the new line. DYNAC isolates the upstream and downstream operations by absorbing the changes in the line and providing a consistent metered flow of bottles.

On the TWG s line a new DYNAC 6900 was positioned between the filler/labeler and the laner/packer, allowing these machine centers to be close to each other, yet operate independently. The resulting DYNAC-centric design provided the desired smaller footprint and ample accumulation, and gave TWG the ability to work multiple line layout options to uncover the most productive design.

 These changes led to incredible advancements in efficiency for our line,  says Dean.

Since the installation of the DYNAC 6900, TWG has seen 10% efficiency gains on its most difficult molds. These gains drive dollar-for-dollar cases down by more than five cents each and represent 50,000 cases of incremental volume annually. As for material savings, Dean estimates that they have  approximately 95% less waste thanks to the DYNAC. 

As TWG does not run a traditional operator-at-each-machine scenario, the DYNAC accumulation provides enough uptime for plant operators to float on the floor where needed.

 We can run lean and prioritize where we are going to focus on the line because of the DYNAC. It provides about seven minutes of uptime when another piece of equipment is down, which gives our operators ample time to repair any issues on the line without interruption,  says Dean.

These time savings of minutes can also add up quickly and result in days of production time not lost over the course of a year.

The above savings could not be possible without proper communication between the equipment on the line and personnel involved.

 The Hartness DYNAC needed to communicate with our labeler and they were in sync when we needed them to be   as soon as we started them,  says Dean.

TWG turned to Hartness for additional secondary packaging solutions. Upstream, the DYNAC was communicating well with the labeler and earlier on with the filler. Downstream, the bottles still needed to be packed. TWG wanted to ensure that the chosen equipment would integrate with the rest of the line, as well as handle the variety of products to be packed on the line. The solution was a Hartness laner and case packer.

Hartness  Global Laner was selected for its high-speed capabilities as well as its smooth, servo-controlled operation and gentle handling of labeled bottles. With a changeover of less than 10 minutes, the laner is flexible enough to handle broad product sizes.

TWG also chose to install the Hartness 2800, a 40-cycles-per-minute servo-controlled case packer. One unique feature of the 2800 is its air transfer system, which eliminates line pressure as it captures the bottles and positions them above the grid for packing. Bottles are vertically loaded through plastic fingers that guide the bottles into the cases.

 What s nice about the Hartness Case Packer is that it can pack directly into a case with or without partitions, which gives us the ability of running two types of glass,  says Dean.

Ensuring successful product delivery, Hartness also provided the conveyor and control from the DYNAC to the packer resulting in a vertically integrated solution. Communication didn t stop at line integration. Training was also important to ensure success post-installation.

 Hartness trained the plant operators very well and worked with them at the pace they needed. Within a couple days, our team was able to pick up on how to operate the equipment properly and it s been working well ever since,  Dean explains.  Whether I needed parts or service performed, Hartness post-install was equally impressive in their customer service and response time. 

Since 1981, The Wine Group has delighted consumers around the world with unbeatable brand value and continuous innovation to consistently exceed their expectations. Having partners like Hartness ensures those values and beliefs are upheld at every stage of production.

 Hartness has been tried and true for us. Whenever we are looking at bottle handling or case handling equipment, Hartness is always at the top of the list based on the partnership that we ve built with them during the last 15-plus years at the Wine Group   and definitely at this facility over the past eight years,  says Dean.  I would say our new line is the most state-of-the art line in California today. ","Packaging"

	Demand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high-value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). &nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89036-us-demand-for-caps-closures-to-approach-12-billion","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","U.S. demand for caps & closures to approach $12 billionDemand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). A mitigating factor for value growth will be continued lightweighting, which drives down the costs of raw material and keeps prices low. These and other trends are presented in Caps & Closures, a new study from The Freedonia Group (freedoniagroup.com), a Cleveland-based industry research firm.

Continued efforts to make foods and beverages more convenient to consume on the go, as well as to control portion sizes, will drive unit demand for caps and closures. Single serving beverage bottles are seeing greater use in fruit juices and drinks, flavored and enhanced waters, and other ready-to-drink beverages as consumers look for substitutes for carbonated soft drinks that can be easily transported and consumed while away from home.

According to analyst Katie Wieser,  Food producers are turning to rigid packaging for single serving snacks to make them less prone to crushing and easier to consume on the go. Both of these trends have bolstered gains for a variety of caps and closures, though plastic threaded caps, dispensing closures, and lids have seen the greatest impact.  These trends will continue to reach new markets and lead to the development of products with even greater levels of convenience, such as spouted pouches for a variety of drinkable foods.

Another factor that affects cap and closure demand is the continued shift from glass bottles and jars to plastic packaging formats. Innovations in hot-fill processing and barrier technologies have allowed plastic bottles and jars to gain significant share from glass alternatives. This has created good opportunities for plastic caps and closures, which will continue to hold the largest share of cap and closure demand and post healthy gains. Of all plastic closure types, dispensing and child-resistant closures will increase the fastest. Metal crowns and screw caps, on the other hand, will see only modest growth due to slow gains for beer production and the rising use of aluminum cans in the craft beer segment. However, metal roll-on caps will help to bolster gains somewhat as they see greater use for still wines and beverages packaged in aluminum bottles.","Packaging"
"The year of bio-based packaging"," 
	Bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89037-the-year-of-bio-based-packaging","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The year of bio-based packagingDerived from renewable materials such as wood fiber from trees or plastic from sugarcane, bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. Granting longer product life, sustainability and other benefits, it is met with enthusiasm from both packagers and consumers.

Though sometimes challenging to make the transition to bio-based substitutes, it would be a surprise to find a food or beverage supplier who hasn t at least tested it. Recent innovations are pushing the boundaries of sustainable packaging, and here are just a few solutions for consumers craving alternatives to traditional packaging.

Produce is one of the first food groups to lose its luster after only a few days in the refrigerator   or on a shelf. Strawberries are notorious for being finicky, waiting to adorn a special dessert or just to be popped into one s mouth.

Tufts University biomedical engineers may have the answer to the fast fruit-rot dilemma. Engineers found that fruits can stay fresh for more than a week without refrigeration if coated in an odorless, nearly invisible biocompatible silk solution. Fibroin, an insoluble protein found in silk, has the ability to stabilize and protect other materials while being fully biocompatible and biodegradable.

Fresh strawberries were dipped in a solution of 1% silk fibroin protein. After repeating the process, the coated fruit was treated with water vapor under vacuum (water annealed) to create varying percentages of crystalline beta-sheets in the coating.

The coated berries were stored at room temperature and dipped in varying numbers of coats of silk that had been annealed at different times and then compared with uncoated berries. Tests showed the silk coating prolonged freshness by slowing fruit respiration, extending fruit firmness and preventing decay.

A new 100% compostable wrapper by Sheffa Foods adorns its coffee house-inspired granola bars. Bio-based and renewable, the flexible package is designed to break down and fully return to nature, becoming part of the food waste stream.

Co-founder Leslie Angle believes that natural food products deserve natural food packaging. The new packaging material decomposes in controlled conditions in less than 180 days. If discarded in a landfill, it will break down like an orange peel and in a  reasonable amount  of time, compared to traditional plastic packaging that decomposes only after hundreds of years.

AIMPLAS (aimplas.net) has coordinated the research to develop new sustainable packages extending the shelf life of cheese and fresh pasta within the framework of the European project BIO4MAP. The result has been a new generation of barrier, multilayer and transparent packages with a 25% lower cost than conventional ones, lower environmental impact and lower carbon footprint by up to 29%.

The layers of bioplastics (PLA, PVOH and adhesives) and a wax coating obtained from olive leaves has made possible, insulating the product from oxygen and humidity in order to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi.

NatureWorks (natureworksllc.com) and Metalvuoto (metalvuoto.it) released a new line of high-barrier Ingeo-based flexible substrates designed to keep processed foods fresh on store shelves   specifically, for flexible packaging. Though used for years in fresh food packaging, this is the first application for longer shelf-life foods packaged in flat, stand up or square-bottom pouches.

The Metalvuoto film allows using a two-layer pouch with performance matching that of three-layer pouches. The Oxaqua coating technology claims to provide excellent barrier as well as heat seal-ability.

Although many brand owners are interested in reviewing their existing packaging to see how its environmental profile can be improved, there are several obstacles to taking it all the way to a bio-based material.

The biggest positive driver is the opportunity bio-based polymers present to brand owners to package products in materials that are as natural as the consumables they are protecting. With safety continuing to be a major consumer and governmental focal point, it is important to eliminate packaging components that might negatively impact the contents. Therefore, it s logical that the ideal goal would be to package food products in material that is derived from other food products.

While many are drawn to the perceived advantages, there are additional considerations that have to be part of the evaluation process. For example, bio-based materials do not lend themselves to the current recycling classification. A material such as PLA, which could be considered a PET substitute, cannot be recycled in the PET waste stream. Instead of the readily understood #1 designation, it would be labeled a #7, creating a potentially negative recycling scenario. Clearly, this is not desirable for brand owners.

The availability and economic viability of bio-based materials are also a significant consideration. Because the demand for these resins is relatively low, supplies are also low. Without volume to drive down cost, it is frequently cost-prohibitive to entertain conversion to these materials.","Packaging"

Honest Marijuana Company packages cannabis in Earth-friendly, reusable tin cans that are brand-new to the industry. The cans keep the product extra fresh. And, they use all-natural growing methods to cultivate eco-conscious cannabis.

In contrast to the countless cannabis companies who package their product in disposable plastic containers, Honest Marijuana Company's cannabis is packaged and sold in recyclable tin cans with pure nitrogen to ensure only the highest level of integrity and quality. This environmentally sound packaging allows for the product to stay in its purest form and not be deteriorated by light or oxygen. Impermeable to oxygen and residual humidity, the tin cans are also inert to temperature fluctuations, meaning that they don't secrete any chemical compounds that will kill the fresh aroma of the cannabis terpenes. The cans preserve the cannabis flowers for years! With this revolutionary new packaging, Anthony hopes to inspire other cannabis companies to place a greater focus on sustainability and caring for Mother Earth.

Anthony Franciosi, founder of Honest Marijuana Company, started growing strains as a healthier way to relieve the pain from years of sports injuries, rather than ingest and possibly get addicted to pain killers. Using organic nutrients like kelp and fish food, the company's plants work symbiotically with the natural nutrients in the soil, so the plant reaches out and draws from the soil precisely what it needs, primarily iron and copper.

 After working in landscaping for many years, I decided to turn my passion for green living, all-natural marijuana cultivation, and holistic pain relief into a full-time career... I grew in a small facility focused on pesticide-free, organic methods, which I believe is the only option for connoisseur quality,  says Franciosi.

Through a ""top feeding"" method, Honest Marijuana Company ensures that 5% or less water is wasted in their facility. Their top-of-the-line sediment filter keeps sediment, chlorine and other harmful elements out of their water supply and out of the town's sewage system. The water chilled climate control system uses 30% less electricity than a standard HVAC system, and it also grabs wasted power and feeds it back into the system to be reused, resulting an additional 10% energy savings. When the external ambient temperature is below 45 degrees, their system is able to utilize the outside air and convert it into another 60-70% energy savings.","Packaging"
"Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger filler"," 
	Many of today's newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88996-integrating-a-form-fill-seal-bag-machine-with-an-auger-filler","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger fillerNew designs in food packaging are constantly being developed and introduced to consumers. While these new trends are sharp and eye-catching, product nevertheless needs to get inside   and that can be tricky at times with smaller openings and different packaging sizes.

Many of these newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. For food manufacturers and packagers, these machines are a major purchase that can take months to accurately specify, quote, build and deliver. The process can become easier by improving communication between the vendors and customer early in the design stages. This will make that process a much quicker and smoother experience for everyone involved   and deliver an FFS machine that s ready for action the first day it s installed.

One of the main components of the design process is the integration of the VFFS machine to an auger filler. These two pieces of equipment need to be in-sync with one another to properly deliver the desired performance for the customer s application.

To get started, the vendors and customer need to share basic information with each other including:

Knowing this information upfront helps vendors determine the scope of the project. It also allows the auger filler supplier to determine if the customer s desired performance specifications for the application can be achieved.

The reason to have answers to these questions in the early stages is that each one influences the other; if one of the answers to a question is unknown, it can change the scope of the project.

The size and shape of the forming tube is one of the most important pieces of information a filler vendor needs in designing a system to integrate with an FFS machine. The amount and speed of which the product can be filled depends largely on the diameter of the auger, and that is dictated by the diameter and shape of the forming tube.

Simple physics comes into play in determining the fill rate. Obviously the larger the forming tube, the more product that can be dispensed in a single auger revolution. For example, an auger that is 2   inches in diameter delivers 12.27 cubic inches of product per revolution, whereas an auger that s just a half inch larger in diameter delivers 24.74 cubic inches of product per revolution  twice as much. The size of the forming tube is of great interest to the filling machine vendor because the company wants to know how much space it has to work with inside that tube. Knowing this up front allows the supplier to determine if the specified speed can be met for the designed pouch size. If it does not, either the bag needs to be redesigned to a larger size or speed requirements must be reduced.

It is also important to review the flow characteristics for each product to be filled. In general, products are free flow or non-free flow, and each requires a different tooling setup. In some cases products can be a little of both, and the result is anything from an occasional drip to a steady stream of product flowing after the auger has completed its cycle. This may require a tooling set up that calls for a clam shell cut-off, a cone cut-off, or possibly the latest technology: vacuum cut-off. All three of these special tooling setups take up additional room in the form tube, causing the size of the auger and therefore, the output speed, to be reduced.

Dust removal is an area that also needs to be factored into the integration of the VFFS machine with the filling machine. Since the pouch is sealed on three sides, any dust from the fill will escape going up. If the application calls for dust collection, then dust collection is required to capture it, and it needs to be located within the forming tube   and that takes up valuable space.

Electrical specifications of each system are another area to consider. Often the end user will have an electrical specification that must be met. The filler supplier needs to know this upfront when quoting the project. There is also the possibility of the VFFS supplier and the filler supplier to share components. A good example of this would be to integrate control screens on a common HMI (human machine interface), thus giving the end user single-point control for the complete system. To do that effectively, it s best to approach this objective early on.

One final point on machine integration: Discuss the factory acceptance test up front during the quoting process. Will there be a test at the filler company, the bagger company or both? What are the criteria for these tests? Will the VFFS company require technical assistance from the filler supplier for the test? What are the criteria for the start, installation and training at the customer s plant? Technical assistance requirements should be defined and planned for in advance.

Bringing in all vendors together with the customer to discuss performance goals and share information early on in the design process will help streamline the integration between the FFS machine and filling machine. Vendors have expertise in their specific areas, and sharing information ensures all aspects of the integration will move along in a smooth and efficient manner.

"From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industry"," 
	The plastics industry in ASEAN remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89034-from-challenges-to-opportunities-favorable-climate-for-the-plastics-industry","Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industryThe plastics industry in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nation) remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries. With K 2016, the world s largest trade fair for plastics and rubber, coming up in D sseldorf, Germany (October 19-26, 2016), here is a closer look at this market.

The new norm of economic growths and trends such as oil prices, variable supply and demand, and weakening of most Asian currencies against the US dollar, have allowed the region s countries to rediscover their strengths to sustain growth either individually or as a part of the collective grouping of the 10-member ASEAN, which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.

ASEAN s fertile consumer base with a combined population of over 600 million and a combined GDP of US$ 2.6 trillion, as well as presence in the global market, enables the region to tap the right opportunities, hinging on the region s rising middle class sector.

One of ASEAN s top export sectors by value is plastics and plastic products earning US$ 39.3 billion in export revenues in 2013.

The sector s production rates have witnessed a steady average growth over the recent years, especially in the ASEAN-6: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, which account for more than 95 % of regional GDP, according to McKinsey & Company.

Vietnam s relatively promising plastics industry had an average annual growth of 16-18 % between 2010 and 2015. Packaging accounts for 37.4 %, followed by consumer goods (27 %), construction (18 %) and technical products (15 %). Yet, the industry is still at the  low end and of low value , according to Vietnam Plastics Association (VPA), with a majority of exports being plastic bags to Japan. It also relies heavily on imported raw materials, like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) resins, importing an average of 4 million tons of raw materials while domestic production totals 1 million tons.

Meanwhile, with a population of over 250 million, Indonesia s government has increased efforts to industrialize and develop the nation towards becoming the world s seventh largest economy by 2030. Its rising middle class, expected to double to 141 million people within the next five years, will drive plastics consumption. According to the Indonesian Packaging Association, food packaging accounts for 70 % of plastic consumption sales. The Aromatic, Olefin and Plastic Industry Association (Inaplas) has set a 6 % growth in domestic demand for the plastics sector, sustained by an improving GDP of 5.3 % in 2016 and upbeat food and beverage and agribusiness sectors.

One of ASEAN s top exporters of plastic products, Malaysia has more than 1,500 plastic production companies that export to Europe, China, Singapore, Japanand Thailand. The packaging sector accounts for 45 % of the total plastic consumption market, followed by electronics (26 %), automotive (10 %) and construction industry (8 %). However, due to a rise in Malaysia s minimum wage to US$ 214 per month, plastic production costs have increased within the country by approximately 10 % over the course of 2015.

Thailand s plastic consumption is led by packaging (48 %), electronics (15 %), construction (14 %), and automotive (8 %). Its automotive sector attracts manufacturing opportunities, although its overall cost index (for example, energy, labor, and property) is 20 to 25 % higher than Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, largely because of a high quality and mature automotive manufacturing ecosystem, including tiered suppliers of automotive components. The country has also invested US$ 60 million into bioplastics development over the past seven years, with the government supplying 80 % of this investment.

Export-oriented Philippines has witnessed weak exports performance, down by 5.8 % in the previous year, because of low demand from its top buyers: the US, China and Japan. The semiconductor and electronics industries account for the majority of the country s exports. Various measures are being instituted to boost exports, such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) of the European Union (EU) that is offering export opportunities to the Philippines by allowing less or no duties on exports to the EU.

Meanwhile, global chemicals hub Singapore, which has been voted the world s most expensive city for expatriates for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), offsets its high costs by offering strong connectivity through shipping routes, a developed infrastructure, manpower capabilities and ease of doing business.

Around 95 companies are represented on Singapore s Jurong Island, attracting investments in excess of S $35 billion, according to the Economic Development Board. Providing a plug-and-play environment, the island allows companies to quickly ramp up their operations, helping growth in both upstream and downstream sectors. Presently, companies like BASF, ExxonMobil Chemical, Lanxess, Mitsui Chemicals, Shell and Sumitomo Chemicals have plants. However, BMI Research expects Singapore to face an uphill climb in 2016, in the face of a Chinese downturn and regional oversupply. Thus, the country is counting on the specialty chemical sector as the next growth area, according to the Economic Survey of Singapore by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).

Pushing the region s plastics industry further, initiatives are being laid out by plastics trade associations, including the ASEAN Federation of Plastics Industries (AFPI), the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA), the Thai Plastic industries Association (TPIA), and the Philippines Plastics Industry Association (PPIA). The associations are working together with international-scale trade agreement blocs, including the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), and the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The AEC, which went into effect on January 1, includes liberalization of goods, investments and services and will enable plastic producing countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore to lower duties on finished plastic products, machines and molds to other member countries like Vietnam, which buys about 80 % of its plastic materials requirements from Thailand and Malaysia.

Indonesia also imports more than 40% of its plastics requirements from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Europe and the US.

The US-led 12-nation TPPA will liberalize trade regulations between the member countries and also eliminate tariffs as high as 25%. The easier access to overseas markets also has benefits for the countries.

The RCEP, made up of ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, aims to consolidate the existing ASEAN FTAs and alliance with the other six partner economies. It will impose a 65 % tariff cut, with the percentage likely to increase to 80 % within a decade. The RCEP could also usher into the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) s long-time prospect of creating a Free Trade Area in the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).

With these optimistic developments, the ASEAN plastics industry will witness an expansion. In the ASEAN Business Outlook Survey 2014, by the American Chamber of Commerce Singapore and US Chamber of Commerce, Indonesia ranked as the most attractive country for new business expansion, followed by Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. Availability of low-cost labor in countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, renders a competitive advantage. Overall, ASEAN s growing consumer bases, broadening of plastic import and export markets, and expanding foreign trading powers offers foreign investors significant opportunities.

"P28 revives packaging with a little help"," 
	The P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89032-p28-revives-packaging-with-a-little-help","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","P28 revives packaging with a little helpThe P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion. TricorBraun (tricorbraun.com) was commissioned and created a true game changer for the high-protein spread.

The company was launched by three brothers in the baking business who decided they needed to get in shape and lose weight. Initially, they turned to an exercise and nutrition program; but when that didn't produce the results they were looking for, they turned to their personal trainer who was also a nutritionist. The brothers plus one joined forces and in 2008, they introduced a bread and the original-high protein spread.

Originally, the high-protein spread was packaged in a 'peanut butter style' jar and wasn't well differentiated nor was it disruptive on shelf. According to Jeff Prince, director of operations at P28,  We wanted to get away from being just another typical spread jar on the shelf. With P28, we are always looking to change the game. We're always looking to be original and offer our customers high quality, innovative products. We wanted that same idea to hold true in our packaging. 

Prince goes on to say,  We chose TricorBraun because of their game changing design capabilities, the quality of their work and their top notch communication.  The process at TricorBraun began with the discovery phase. This allowed the team to clearly comprehend, define and help P28 realize their vision. Many things were taken into consideration including brand, competitive landscape, technical restraints and success criteria.

It was clear that the package needed to be a PET 16 oz. jar and that there were seven SKUs but according to Prince,  We were searching for something unique, exciting and high quality that screamed pick me up! If the consumer picked up the jar just to feel the difference in the structure, we knew this would ultimately lead them to reading about our product and its benefits. 

According to Samantha Juna, package design manager, TricorBraun,  We looked at a variety of shapes, closures and different deco methods including labeling vs. shrink sleeving the bottle; but the big turning point came when we agreed to play up the sports angle and truly differentiate from a regular peanut butter. We explored surface changes, more pronounced textures and athletic silhouettes. We took inspiration from some of the sports drinks on the market.  She explains further,  We essentially left the peanut butter category and went to nutraceutical. 

About the time of reaching design freeze, TricorBraun's graphic design manager Molly Fuehrmeyer was revamping the current graphics and applying them to the structure for visualization.  The goal was to highlight the attributes of the shape of the bottle and we were confident that a shrink sleeve would be the best deco method to capture the vignette on the arch,  she explains.

Fuehrmeyer adds,  The first approach was to take the original artwork and conservatively make it work with the new structure but P28 felt that a more playful look was needed while retaining the established SKU colors and the logo positioning.  The final artwork includes opaque areas where the text is clearly readable. This leads to a vignette that accentuates the shape and then a clear arch that reveals how much product is left. It was important for the flavors: almond butter, signature blend, white chocolate, banana raisin, caramel turtle, peanut butter and apple crisp to be very visible on shelf.

After a year in the making, the product was launched in the summer of 2015 and in 2016, the package design recently won the PAC  Global Leadership Award: Silver in the Food & Beverage Brand Revitalization category.

TricorBraun orchestrated the process with multiple outside suppliers. The bottle is manufactured by Pretium, the stock closure is from PANO and the shrink sleeve is done by Metro Label. The bottles are filled by P28 and can be found in retail in the US at all Vitamin Shoppe locations, 800+ Wal-Mart locations, all Wegmans and thousands of others. In Canada, the product can be found at Popeye's and online at SupplementSource.ca and SupplementsCanada.com.

P28 Foods is a high-protein food company located in Syracuse, NY. Founded by third-generation bakers, the company is dedicated to providing our customers the most delicious and nutritious high protein food products available.","Packaging"

","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89027-sagamore-spirit-introduces-new-premium-straight-rye-whiskey","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Sagamore Spirit introduces new premium straight rye whiskeySagamore Spirit is marking a new entry into the American whiskey marketplace with the introduction of its premium Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Whiskey in three major markets in the United States Maryland, Washington, DC and Delaware with New York to follow shortly.

 Maryland has a deep history and heritage with distilling rye whiskey that dates back to before Prohibition,  says Brian Treacy, president of Sagamore Spirit.  Maryland was home to more than 40 distilleries and we honor that tradition by making a spirit worthy of our state s distilling heritage. 

To help create an innovative and beautiful package which would adhere closely to the new premium spirit s quality taste and smooth finish, it called upon Saxco International LLC (saxco.com) of Horsham, PA, world-wide packaging specialists for the wine, spirits, beer and food industries and its vast global resource network to assist.  Our role was to help create an attractive and colorful new package that would also deliver a prominent and distinctive shelf presence and bring the project to a successful conclusion,  states Beth-Anne Kline, regional sales manager for Saxco International, who coordinated on the project with Saxco s Eric Guli, supply chain project manager.

Working closely with Sagamore s brand management team, along with creative collaboration between Sagamore Creative, of Baltimore, MD and Ptarmak, of Austin, TX, Saxco helped create a high-quality custom mold. The mold included a diamond shaped 750ml flint bottle with flat shoulders and embossed logos on the front, back and heavy glass bottom. Saxco then provided a reliable, time-tested overseas source to produce the bottle which incorporates embossed 1909 logos on the front and back and a three diamond logo on the bottom. The 1909 logo signifies the year the Sagamore Farm Springhouse was built, where Sagamore Spirit draws water to cut their rye whiskey to 83-proof.  The farm is built on a shelf of limestone rock and limestone water makes for some of the best rye whiskey you can have,  explains Treacy.

Saxco also supplied a rich looking custom black wood top natural cork assembly for the bottle s closure from a longtime quality supply source in Portugal. The wood top has a three diamond logo imprinted on the top. The closure was over fitted with a burgundy and black capsule from one of Saxco s long time trusted suppliers in California.

 

 The tricolor pressure sensitive labels were completed by a Sagamore Spirit source and hand applied to each bottle. Every bottle is hand labeled with a batch number, bottler number and signed by the bottler.

Sagamore Straight Rye Whiskey is 83-proof and 41.5 percent alcohol by volume and is being bottled in Baltimore, Maryland. The distilling team blends two different mash bills, a high rye and a low rye and then adds the Sagamore Farm spring-fed water to cut the whiskey to proof.","Packaging"
"Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020"," 
	Emergence of sustainable materials will accelerate the growth of ampoules packaging through 2020.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89023-global-ampoules-packaging-market-to-grow-through-2020","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020According to the latest research report released by Technavio, the global ampoules packaging market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% until 2020.

  Increased environmental concerns among consumers have increased the demand for sustainable packaging materials, thereby influencing the ampoule packaging market. Ampoules are made of conventional plastics, which do not decompose easily. Vendors are adopting sustainable materials to reduce the dependency on conventional plastics and adopt eco-friendly practices. The emergence of green plastics or biodegradable plastics will fuel the growth of the market during the forecast period,  says Sharan Raj, a lead industry analysts for packaging at Technavio.



  These plastics made from petrochemicals and contain biodegradable additives. They can be easily decomposed by microorganisms and produce less toxic gasses compared to conventional plastics. Increased use of materials, including polyvinyl alcohol, polyanhydrides and polylactic acid by plastic packaging manufacturers will reduce the market share of conventional plastics. Vendors in ampoules packaging are increasingly using biodegradable plastics to comply with stringent environmental regulations,  says Sharan.

Some of the other driving forces behind the growth of the global ampoules packaging market are as follows:

Increased prevalence of chronic diseases and infections

 Increased prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., cancer and tuberculosis) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) serves the ampoules packaging market as a driver. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 592 million by 2035.

In addition, the number of patients with infectious respiratory, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted diseases (HIV infection and AIDS) as well as hospital-acquired infections (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) has also increased.

Rising number of chronic diseases are increasing the demand for vaccines and anti-thrombotic drugs in the market. Owing to these developments, the global market for antithrombotic drugs is projected to reach U.S. $21.6 billion by the end of 2018. Thus, the increased prevalence, early diagnosis and regular monitoring of chronic diseases is likely to increase the demand for ampoules packaging during the forecast period.

Strict government regulations and standards

 Strict government regulations and industry standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products have resulted in a positive impact on the market. According to FDA regulations in the U.S., pharmaceutical solutions or drugs need high barrier packaging materials and sealants that are impermeable and resistant to solvents, grease, chemicals, and heat. Government regulations in developed countries such as Japan and European countries demand greater barrier and security protection of medical supplies and devices. In addition, for the supply medical products produced nationally to the domestic and international markets, governments in developing countries such as China and India have upgraded their industry standards for ampoule packaging to maintain quality, safety, and reduce breakage, spillage, and contamination. Thus, strict regulations and standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products are expected to fuel the growth of the ampoules packaging market until 2020.



 Significant growth in emerging countries

 The global ampoules product manufacturers are focusing on emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) to expand their operations. The governments are taking initiatives to build healthcare infrastructures and increase healthcare budgets. They are also focusing on the improvement of diagnostic procedures. Due to air pollution and water contamination, there has been an increase in the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases. BRIC countries represent an attractive market for multi-national corporations in the healthcare industry owing to the rising awareness among consumers about chronic and infectious diseases. For instance, in 2011, Russian manufacturing, packaging, and R&D division received an assurance from the Association of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers to invest a minimum amount of $1 billion. Novartis is also investing $500 million by 2016. In addition, Novo Nordisk, Nycomed, and Sanofi have also expanded their businesses in Russia. Other pharmaceutical companies like Roche have partnered with local pharmaceutical companies under out-licensing agreements. All these factors will fuel the global ampoules packaging market in the forecast period.","Packaging"

"Popularity of organic baby food to push growth of market"," 
	The growing popularity of organic baby food will aid in the growth of the global baby food, infant formula market through 2020, reports Technavio. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89020-popularity-of-organic-baby-food-to-push-growth-of-market","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Popularity of organic baby food to push growth of marketThe growing popularity of organic baby food will aid in the growth of the global baby food, infant formula market through 2020, reports Technavio (technavio.com).

Technavio s latest report on the global baby food and infant formula market provides an analysis on the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2016-2020. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline.

The top four emerging trends driving the global baby food and infant formula market according to Technavio food and beverageresearch analysts are:

Packaging and innovation

 In terms of packaging, products in glass or tubs contribute to the majority of baby food sales. However, fast growth is experienced by pouches, i.e., containers with plastic spouts on the top from which food can be sipped. The popularity of pouches is mainly attributed to their ease and flexibility. Baby food pouches are convenient and portable nutrition, as they are extremely compatible with consumers' on-the-go lifestyles and significantly promotes independent feeding.

 Baby food pouches act as food-grade barrier film that aids in keeping the content inside the pouch fresh for longer. In addition, parents feed their baby in small portions and seal the food back in the pouch for later use. Baby food pouch storage is convenient in comparison to box and glass counterparts, as pouches do not occupy much space in diaper bags or the home pantry.

Growing popularity of organic baby food

 With environmental conditions deteriorating globally, there is a rising anxiety as to the safety of the products we use and, even more so, the food we consume.  A growing trend towards organic products is witnessed, which stems from a concern for our health and general wellbeing and, even more so, that of our children. Organic baby products, food in particular, have therefore garnered much attention in recent years,  says Vijay Sarathi, a lead analyst at Technavio for food research.

Organic baby food products are in demand due to its many benefits. It contains no chemicals, pesticides, preservatives, hormones, or antibiotics. Many stipulations govern the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of organic baby food. All the cereals must be grown without using chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Dairy and poultry products are derived from livestock, which are fed organic feed and not administered growth hormones. The foods, once prepared, contain no preservatives, artificial flavors or colors, or other additives.

Expansion of product portfolios by vendors

 Consumers increasingly demand varied options in terms of blends and flavors to cater to their babies  nutritional requirement. Leading baby food manufacturers continually update their product lines to include new and unique products that set them apart from the competition. In July 2013, Plum Organics launched a toddler snack range, Mighty 4, a range of blended organic fruits, vegetables and grains.

Furthermore, it is believed that offering different variants and flavors of vegetables, fruits, and cereals will help develop the food habits of babies as they grow. In addition, companies are continuously developing their products to improve them, as parents prefer to give healthy and tasty food to their babies. Abbott launched non-GMO infant formula Similac in the US in 2015. In addition, it contains OptiGRO, which significantly helps in the development of babies' brains and eyes. It also launched products in the China, India, and Europe nutrition markets. Therefore, the extension of product portfolios by vendors is another driver that is propelling the growth of the market.

Increase in online purchasing

 E-commerce retailers are competing with physical stores in terms of convenience and price, as the online platform reduces and eliminates physical infrastructure. In addition, online platform, in some cases, eliminates links in supply chain, helping them to provide products at a reduced cost. The online platform offers busy parents of compelling proposition of shopping whenever and wherever possible. Approximately 18% of parents have brought baby food online in 2015.

  Around one-third of people in APAC have ordered baby food through the online platform. Hong Kong and South Korea are the key leading regions in terms of purchasing baby food and infant formula through the online platform,  says Vijay.","Packaging"

The products are sold in combiblocCompact with screw cap combiSmart from SIG Combibloc (sig.biz). With this product launch, Alpura and SIG Combibloc are kicking off their partnership with an innovative product, as evaporated milk in carton packs with a screw cap is a newcomer to the Mexican market and offers a new solution for retail.

Founded in Mexico in 1972, Alpura is now the country s second-largest dairy company, with around 6,000 employees and a further 7,000 indirect contributors (farm workers and suppliers). More than 123 farms are part of the company. Each day, these farms produce an average of 2.9 million liters of milk, which is then processed at the cooperative s two production plants in Cuautitl n Izcalli (Mexico) and Ciudad Delicias (Chihuahua). The company s product range includes more than 87 products from the segments milk, yogurt, cream, cheese, butter and desserts.

Alpura is now expanding its product portfolio with the addition of evaporated milk, and has opted for filling technology from SIG Combibloc to fill the products. A CFA 612 filling machine to fill products in aseptic carton packs combiblocCompact has been installed. This filling machine can fill a total of seven different volume sizes. The Alpura evaporated milk carton packs are fitted with the reclosable screw cap combiSmart.

 Evaporated milk in carton packs with screw cap is an innovation for the Mexican market. Previously, evaporated milk was mainly available here in food metal cans. For serving, people then usually put the products into a small pot or jug. But those days are over. With the screw cap, the milk can be neatly poured and conveniently portioned out directly from the carton pack. After use, the carton pack can be reclosed, so the product remains protected even after it s been opened for the first time. This is extremely convenient for consumers. We re very proud that we ve marked the beginning of our partnership with Alpura with an innovation,"" says Antonio Fiumara, head of sales in Mexico at SIG Combibloc.

Jorge Aguilar, CEO of Alpura adds,  We are confident that with evaporated milk in reclosable carton packs, we re offering consumers real added value. With the convenient, easy-open closure, the package fits perfectly with the convenience trend that modern consumers demand. The carton pack is very easy to open and conveniently reclose, because combiSmart has little  wings  on the sides of the screw cap.  The closure is applied to the closed and sealed carton pack by an applicator after the aseptic filling process has taken place. There is no need for pre-perforation of the cardboard   the cutting ring in the flange slices through the coated cardboard cleanly and effortlessly with a single twist.","Packaging"
"Fruit packed in corrugated is safer and fresher"," 
	New scientific research indicates that corrugated packaging keeps fruit fresher and safer than reusable plastic crates (RPCs) and can significantly reduce contamination from transferred microorganisms.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89019-fruit-packed-in-corrugated-is-safer-and-fresher","Fri, 05 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Fruit packed in corrugated is safer and fresherNew scientific research indicates that corrugated packaging keeps fruit fresher and safer than reusable plastic crates (RPCs) and can significantly reduce contamination from transferred microorganisms.

The research, conducted by the University of Bologna and initiated by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO), found that corrugated trays ensured higher-quality packed fruits with reduced microbial cross-contamination and longer shelf-life. Lower bacterial contamination decreases the risk of foodborne illnesses and increases the fruit s freshness, scent, appearance and taste.

Microbiological contamination of fresh produce is a major concern for retailers. Pathogenic bacteria can make people sick, and spoilage bacteria reduces shelf-life. In both cases, the role of packaging can be critical.

 We are encouraged by the most recent research conducted by the University of Bologna , says Dennis Colley, president and CEO of the U.S.-based Fibre Box Association (FBA).  We know corrugated is clean when it reaches the grower/shipper. Now, this research shows corrugated, in addition to cushioning and protecting produce, also mitigates the spread of contamination if the container becomes contaminated while packing or if fresh produce begins to decay during transportation. The ability of corrugated packaging to increase shelf-life could translate into significantly reduced shrink and potentially millions of dollars in savings for retailers.""

The research was led by Professor Rosalba Lanciotti at the University of Bologna s Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences. It examined the exchange of microbes between produce and packaging and vice-versa, and focused especially on determining how differences in packaging materials can influence cross-contamination.

The results showed that fruit packed in corrugated fared better (with fewer transferred pathogenic and spoilage bacteria) than the fruit packed in RPCs. The differences in microbiological quality were statistically significant.

Methodology

 Scientists deliberately contaminated both corrugated trays and RPCs with the same number of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pseudomonas spp. microorganisms. Fresh peaches were washed with tap water, sterilized with a sodium solution, rinsed with sterilized water and then air-dried before being placed into the containers for testing. Next, researchers measured the levels of bacteria that transferred to the fruit over time.

Results

 Fruit packed in plastic crates reached contamination levels generally associated with spoilage 48 to 72 hours earlier than the fruit packed in corrugated trays.

Contributing factors such as storage temperature, length of time before sale, and superficial damage on the peaches were also considered. Results showed that all these factors influenced the microbial transfer from packaging material to fruit, but the transfer of spoilage microorganisms was always lower in corrugated trays.

The tests also showed that in some conditions (i.e. high storage temperature) up to 95% of peaches packed in the deliberately contaminated RPCs were infected with E. coli after 48 hours. By contrast, the E. coli contamination level never exceeded 25% of the peaches packed in corrugated containers that had been contaminated with the same levels of microorganisms.

Rising Concerns

 The research comes as other concerns have been raised recently over the hygiene of RPCs. Last November, the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas showed that typical industry cleaning procedures failed to adequately sanitize RPCs. The research team led by Dr. Steven Ricke found Salmonella cells on the crates even after cleaning. He noted that bacteria hide in the cracks and crevices of the crates  surface, making it difficult for industrial sanitizers to reach them.

Conclusion

 University of Bologna s new study proved that using corrugated instead of plastic packaging for fruit can significantly reduce potential contamination via microbial transfer. Professor Lanciotti and her team concluded that peaches packed in corrugated therefore reach consumers in a safer and fresher state than those in plastic crates.","Packaging"
"Distilleries: how to use liquid filling machines for wine & spirits"," 
	Artisanal distillers, craft distillers, and micro distillers are some of the facilities that require liquid filling machines intended to handle the various types of wines and spirits they are likely to produce and bottle.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89018-how-can-distilleries-utilize-liquid-filling-machines-for-wines-spirits","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Distilleries: how to use liquid filling machines for wine & spiritsArtisanal distillers, craft distillers, and micro distillers are some of the facilities that require liquid filling machines intended to handle the various types of wines and spirits they are likely to produce and bottle. Machinery needs to be able to scale based on the changing production needs. Modern liquid fillers can accommodate for these needs, allowing for complete adaptability to changing environments. Wine and spirit consumers often trust specific companies because of the consistent quality of their products, and liquid filling machines contribute to this consistency in several ways.

 

 There are a couple of types of overflow liquid filling machines that are ideal for filling wine and spirit bottles, based on the viscosity and the type of packaging requirements.

Sanitary Overflow Fillers

 One type of liquid filling machine that is commonly used for wine and spirits is the sanitary overflow filler. They are designed with quick breakdown fittings, pumps and valves to use when needed. They can effectively keep bacteria out of wine and spirit packaging throughout the filling process, preventing contamination that can spoil these products prior to consumption. They can also provide a consistent fill level for products that need it.

The easy breakdown of parts allows for simple cleaning, which helps avoid the buildup of bacteria and mold on parts that could potentially leak into products during filling. Like other overflow machines, sanitary overflow fillers are designed to handle low-viscosity to water-thin products, which include most spirits and wines. They are also ideal for applications with transparent bottles that allow for total visibility of the fill level.

Tabletop Overflow Fillers

 Some applications don't have the space to handle full-size liquid filling machines, requiring the use of portable or tabletop machinery. If a facility needs overflow equipment that can meet tight space requirements and frequently changing equipment configurations, tabletop overflow liquid fillers are ideal. Like other overflow machines, these tabletop models can fill most low-viscosity to water-thin liquids, while allowing facility managers to place them nearly anywhere in the production line.

The difference between tabletop overflow fillers and other formats is the ability to perform changeover between parts within minutes to reduce downtime when reworking machine configurations. Typical tabletop overflow fillers also provide easy general operation, simply requiring the user to manually place bottles beneath the fill heads using an adjustable railing before successfully filling bottles with the flip of a couple of switches.

Other Types of Liquid Packaging Equipment

 While high-quality liquid fillers are vital to the actual filling step of the liquid packaging process, there are many other machines that distilleries should consider when packaging wines and spirits. These machines can include conveyors, spindle or chuck cappers, bottle cleaners (including air rinsers), case packers, palletizers and labelers.

Integrating a sanitary or tabletop overflow filler along with all of this machinery can help ensure that your wines and spirits experience consistently reliable filling, with consistent and accurate fill levels that prevent product wastage and contamination. Facilities will be able to benefit from maximized productivity and efficiency, meeting business goals and consumer demand for wine and spirit products.

A complete system of reliable overflow fillers and other liquid packaging machines will give your facility what it needs to give you the best results when producing wine and spirits.","Packaging"

"New York State Chocolate takes Barkeater bars through rebrand"," 
	The bar packaging was redesigned and upgraded from plastic sleeves to paperboard boxes to modernize the look and make the prominent ingredients stand out easily to the consumer.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89015-new-york-state-chocolate-takes-barkeater-bars-through-rebrand","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","New York State Chocolate takes Barkeater bars through rebrandEarlier this year, Barkeater Chocolates debuted their brand new packaging for their six gourmet chocolate bars, which according to co-owners Deb & Jim Morris, has been met with rave reviews. The bar packaging was redesigned and upgraded from plastic sleeves to paperboard boxes to modernize the look and make the prominent ingredients stand out easily to the consumer.

The company used the debut of Quinoa Ka-Pow!, a gourmet dark chocolate bar with crunchy quinoa, to redesign the look of their five other bars. The bars offered from Barkeater Chocolates are Downhill Darksider with sea salt, Beantown Bold with finely ground espresso, Citrus Surprise with orange, Black Bear with black raspberry & black pepper, and Cherry Chic. The cherry bar is described on its new package as a silky milk chocolate bar that 'tastes like a cherry cordial, but without the mess.' Cherry Chic is one of several chocolate confections that source mainly domestic ingredients.

The bars are just one part of Barkeater Chocolates' vast product lineup. Their Grown Up Peanut Butter Cups come in both milk and dark chocolate and boast all natural crunchy peanut butter. The peanut butter cups had a packaging overhaul in early 2015 and are labeled seriously addictive. According to Jim Morris, co-owner, ""We have not seen other peanut butter cups manufactured with crunchy peanut butter, that is also all-natural, anywhere in the Northeast.""

The rebranded chocolate bars have made a big splash in upstate NY as the company's move was featured on newscasts and articles throughout New York's Capital Region. Deb Morris, co-owner says,  We have received tremendous response about our packaging makeover. The bars are now wrapped in paperboard boxes with their main ingredients boldly displayed.  And speaking of ingredients, Barkeater Chocolates prides itself on using only natural, wholesome ingredients that are also gluten-free and non-GMO. Barkeater uses locally sourced and US grown ingredients whenever possible.

Since their inception in 2008, Barkeater Chocolates has won numerous awards, including a Business Excellence Award from the U.S. Small Business Administration in 2014, and the Adirondack Life 2015 Reader's Choice award for Best Chocolate/Candy Company in the Adirondack Park.

The company's natural and gluten-free chocolate bars, grown-up peanut butter cups, bark and other hand-made confections are made in the USA and available in more than 150 retail stores from the Adirondacks to New York City, and throughout New England & the Mid-Atlantic states. The gourmet chocolate can also be shipped anywhere in the country via online ordering.","Packaging"

"Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave Purchase","The Cornucopia Institute is contesting the acquisition of WhiteWave Foods by  Groupe Danone as being anti-competitive in the U.S. organic milk and organic yogurt markets.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/complaints-filed-over-danones-white-wave-purchase/","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 12:49:00 -0400","NA","Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave PurchaseThe proposed acquisition by French food giant Groupe Danone of WhiteWave Foods is being contested by an industry watchdog, the Cornucopia Institute, which says the move ""will have a serious anti-competitive effect on the organic yogurt and organic fluid milk markets in the U.S.""

The Wisconsin-based institute filed complaints with both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, stating the acquisition would also have a negative economic impact on U.S. organic dairy farmers.

At a purchase price exceeding $10 billion, the deal would combine Stonyfield, Horizon and Wallaby to dominate the organic dairy market. Horizon organic milk controls nearly 25 percent of the organic milk market, while its Silk brand is a leader in plant-based beverages. Danone would be taking control of a bigger piece of the organic dairy market than has ever been controlled by a single company before, says the institute, which also launched a petition drive pushing for a full investigation of the proposed merger by federal regulators.

""With this acquisition, we are concerned that Danone will easily be able to beat out any competition by lowering prices beyond what farmstead dairies, and more moderately sized milk processors and marketers, can withstand,"" said Marie Burcham, a livestock policy analyst with the Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit organization representing farms and consumers with interests in the organic dairy market.

The market for organic dairy already has less competition than other agricultural sectors and is more susceptible to monopolization, Burcham continued. ""It is important that the authorities look at the anti-competitive implications of the Danone-WhiteWave deal,"" she added. ""We ask that they consider the organic dairy and organic yogurt markets in particular as different and already more concentrated markets in comparison to Danone s other, non-organic market share.""","F&B"

"Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First Year","Vegan mayonnaise company told workers, contractors to quietly buy hundreds of jars of Just Mayo to inflate sales.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/hampton-creek-buyback/","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 15:27:00 -0400","NA","Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First YearVegan mayonnaise creator Hampton Creek Inc. pumped up first-year sales and general buzz by having employees and contractors buy up jars of its Just Mayo, according to an investigation by Bloomberg News.

The news medium reported Aug 4. it had uncovered payment receipts and talked to former employees and contractors who were told to go to Safeway and other early retailers of the product in 2014 and buy hundreds of jars and otherwise talk up the product while hiding the fact they were employed by Hampton Creek.

Entrepreneur/founder Josh Tetrick, who remains CEO of the company, admitted the tactic but said it amounts to about $77,000, representing less than 0.12 percent of the company s sales. Bloomberg hinted that it could be much more, but did not specify an amount.

Tetrick said the tactic was more about quality control than trying to inflate sales. He said the employees and contractors were told to check jars for misaligned labels, breakage or issues involving ingredient separation, which he said occurred early on when the pea protein spread was exposed to extreme temperatures in transit.

Whichever, it certainly helped Tetrick raise an early $90 million to fund his startup. We profiled Tetrick and Hampton Creek in a September 2015 cover story titled ""Hero or Hustler?"" -- a story that made Food Processing and Managing Editor Kevin Higgins a finalist in the coveted Jesse Neal Awards.

 We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos,  Caroline Love, Hampton Creek s then-director of corporate partnership, wrote in an April 2014 e-mail to contract workers, which Bloomberg obtained.  And we re going to pay you for this exciting new project! Below is the list of stores that have been assigned to you. 

Former workers say Hampton Creek also purchased its own products at Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target and Whole Foods locations across the country. While a November 2014 e-mail from the corporate partnerships team said the company would stop store buyouts, three former contractors who worked for the company in 2015 say the practice continued, but directions became verbal, not written, according to Bloomberg.

Five former Hampton Creek contractors and two ex-senior staff members say the buyback assignments were separate from quality checks at stores. The ex-contractors say in most cases they were told to simply buy up jars at nearby stores and were free to consume or discard them, not look for quality issues, according to the Bloomberg story.

One former contractor provided receipts showing purchases of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a single day. Another contractor said he bought at least 20 jars per store after being directed to visit more than a dozen stores in less than a week.

In that crucial time period, from April 2014 to April 2015, Hampton Creek's grocery store sales were $4.6 million, not including sales at Whole Foods, according to an IRI report cited by Fast Company. Sales more than doubled the following year, and Tetrick told the magazine he expects $100 million in sales this year.

Since Hampton Creek is a privately held company, it may not have broken any laws.","F&B"

It s the only list of its kind, one that ranks companies as U.S. and Canadian food and beverage processors, stripping away the commodity ingredients, the products made and sold in China and the deodorants and shampoos.

We don t mean to make this into some kind of competition, especially since the numbers you see involve some interpretation by us. But it is worth noting that Tyson unseated PepsiCo, which had held the No. 1 position on the chart for five years. This is not Tyson s first turn as the No. 1 company; the Arkansas firm in 2006 ended a 30-year run by Kraft Foods.

It s also a good scorecard for the general health of the food and beverage industry. Looking beyond the top-line sales figures tells a lot about the current state of business ... although generalizations are hard to come up with.

It s safe to call that a mixed bag, certainly not a stellar performance across the board. But it s never easy, is it? Even the star performers within the chart did well mostly because of sizable acquisitions. Tyson is one, its sales growing by more than 11 percent, although that $4 billion bump entirely may be due to its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. But its 43 percent increase in net income is a testament to its management of this big acquisition and the debt it involved.

J.M. Smucker is in the same two boats. Its $2 billion sales increase (thanks to its purchase of Big Heart Pet Brands) is great, but its nearly 100 percent increase in profit took real finesse.

Less worthy of compliment is Post Holdings  near-doubling of sales (due to the acquisitions of MOM Brands and Michael Foods), which only kept it $115 million in red ink.

Deal-making in the food and beverage industry set a new record in 2014, hitting 510. Despite being 18 percent lower, 410 transactions made last year was one of the busiest years for buying and selling food & beverage companies, according to records compiled by The Food Institute.

The number of food industry mergers may be down in 2015, but Mergermarket estimates the value of deals in the food segment reached a near-record high of $120.8 billion, jumping 57.8 percent from even that record prior year. What is causing this gap between transactions and value? Megadeals. Megadeals are becoming more popular as companies find the only way to keep their share of the market is to merge with the competition.

And 2015 saw its share of megadeals. The poster child was the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Co. The transaction created the third largest food and beverage company in North America (by some accounts, although not Food Processing's) and the fifth largest food & beverage company in the world, according to the companies. The Kraft Heinz Co., which has estimated revenues of about $28 billion, is now public again and co-headquartered in Pittsburgh and a Chicago suburb.

Other notable acquisitions in the sector included J.M. Smucker Co. s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands for approximately $5.8 billion, Snyder's-Lance Inc. s purchase of Diamond Foods Inc., Post Holdings Inc. s deal for MOM Brands Co. and TreeHouse Foods  acquisition of ConAgra Foods' private label operations.

In the bakery category, Flowers Foods and Hearthside Food Solutions were the most active companies, each with two acquisitions. The largest deal was Flowers  acquisition of organic bread maker Dave's Killer Bread for approximately $275 million in cash. In confectionery, Hershey Co. bought jerky-maker Krave Pure Foods Inc., and Barry Callebaut Group purchased the assets of American Almond Products Co. Inc., a producer of artisanal nut-based ingredients.

One of the larger deals in the fruit & vegetable category was Del Monte Foods  acquisition of Sager Creek Vegetable Co. (formerly known as Allens Inc.) for $75 million. In meats, the big deal was JBS USA Pork s acquisition of Cargill's U.S. pork business for about $1.4 billion. In poultry, Perdue Farms bought Natural Food Holdings from LNK Partners, including the Niman Ranch and Prairie Grove brands.

In the Food Institute's ""other"" category, McCormick & Co. made three acquisitions, buying One World Foods for approximately $100 million, Brand Aromatics for $63 million, and Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately $97 million. Seafood processors were noticeably more active in 2015 than in previous years, taking part in almost as many deals in 2015 as in the previous five years combined, but all of them relatively small.

"Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher Profits","After a year of cost-cutting, many companies are improving their bottom lines at the expense of their top lines.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/top-100-food-companies/","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 09:27:00 -0400","NA","Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher ProfitsUsually, our Top 100  table shows a healthy food and beverage industry with sales and profits on the rise   as should be expected in a year in which the country s overall economy is plugging along, albeit without setting records.

Look a little closer at the figures and the underlying situations, and we see an industry struggling to achieve growth. Especially among the bigger firms. Only one of the 16 largest companies saw sales grow appreciably in 2015, and that company, Tyson, did so mostly through a huge acquisition. All the others undoubtedly made some acquisitions in the past year, which didn t do enough to prop up sales.

Tyson, by the way, is the new No. 1 company atop the U.S. and Canadian food and beverage industry, thanks to the $4 billion bump by former No. 32 company Hillshire Brands. Tyson was No. 1 back in 2006, having ended about a 30-year run by Kraft Foods as the largest food & beverage processor in the U.S. and Canada. This time, it ended PepsiCo s five-year turn atop our list.

 We have an incredible team at Tyson Foods and our focus on consumer-relevant categories is what got us here,  CEO Donnie Smith told us when he learned of the No. 1 ranking.  We ve invested in our prepared foods brands, chicken and the insights that drive innovation for a better consumer experience. 

For the overall food and beverage industry, profits are a slightly better picture   maybe. Net income was up at five of the top 16   which means the bottom line worsened for eight. (No. 11 Mars is a private company and doesn t tell us profits and for No. 5 Kraft Heinz we had no 2014 figure to compare its profit to.)

As we prepared this report, AdvancePierre Foods was planning an initial public offering of stock. The six-year-old Cincinnati company was seeking to raise $100 million but it will remain majority-owned by Oaktree Capital. APF is the result of a 2010 merger of Pierre Foods, Advance Food Co. and Advance Brands   and Advance Brands itself was a joint venture between Advance Food Co. and Cargill Meat Solutions. Hostess Brands, which had a soap opera of bankruptcies in 2004 and 2012, was sold off in pieces in its 2013 liquidation. But the biggest part and the name went to investor C. Dean Metropoulos and his Apollo Global Management LLC. Now, in a complex transaction, Metropoulos and Apollo Global Management will transfer ownership to newly formed Gores Holdings, but they will hold a 42 percent stake in Gores Holdings. Gores Holdings reportedly plans to reintroduce Hostess as a publicly listed company, perhaps late this year, with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.3 billion.

Mondelez is a great case in point. While the North American-only figures show a tiny improvement, worldwide sales were down nearly $5 billion; but net income nearly tripled from 2014 to a sensational $7.3 billion.

The view is only a little better at the bottom third of our table, where 12 of the 33 smaller companies gained sales ground and seven improved profits.

The figures punctuate the stories told at the Consumer Analysts Group of New York conference, where the top food and beverage companies annually make presentations to financial analysts. At that February meeting, the CEOs and CFOs of Campbell Soup, General Mills, Hormel and Mondelez all said recent years of cost-cutting are paying off in increased profits but decreased sales. Even at that meeting, Tyson happily bucked the trend, predicting both sales and profits would turn higher this year.

 The food processing industry tends to track the U.S. economy and therefore continues to grow at a steady pace,  says Casey Garten, managing director of food and agribusiness at Bank of the West Commercial Banking Group.  The industry is well capitalized with interest rates at historic lows, which provides opportunities for growth to meet growing demand. 

There are three big gainers on the table, all the result of full-year effects of major acquisitions. As previously stated, Tyson added $4 billion in sales largely because of its late-2014 purchase of Hillshire Brands. J.M. Smucker (whose 2016 fiscal year ended this April 30) grew 37 percent and moved from No. 23 last year to No. 17 this year thanks to the early-2015 acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands   the former Del Monte unit that includes Gravy Train and Meow Mix   and its $2.3 billion in sales.","F&B"

"Ingredients for Heart Health","Processors are formulating-out fat and sodium and working in legumes, whole grains, soluble fiber and omega-3s.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/ingredients-for-heart-health/","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 15:13:00 -0400","NA","Ingredients for Heart HealthFollowing a healthy diet and lifestyle are good weapons in the fight against cardiovascular disease, and they're becoming easier to follow. A report from the American Heart Assn. (www.heart.org), Dallas, indicates the amount of products labeled vegetarian and vegan, which it says are better for the heart, are increasing in the market.

People with a low incidence of coronary heart disease tend to have low blood cholesterol levels and also tend to have diets not only low in total fat but relatively high in plant foods that contain dietary fiber, notes the FDA. This might be why global launches of vegetarian foods and beverage shot up 60 percent between 2011 and 2015, according to figures from Innova Market Insights.

Studies show vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and some forms of cancer, the AMA adds. The caveat is that vegetarians and vegans often must find other sources of essential nutrients -- such as iron, magnesium, protein, omega 3 fatty acids, potassium and calcium   that are plentiful in animal foods, the association points out.

Beans, whole grains, soluble fiber and fish containing omega-3 fatty acids can lower the risk of stroke by keeping cholesterol from forming plaque buildup in the arteries, the AMA says. Oatmeal can lower plaque s ability to form clots that can cause blockages. Whole-grain cereals (like Cheerios) can help reduce cholesterol, and foods containing potassium, calcium and magnesium can lower blood pressure, which can reduce strain on the blood vessels and inflammation.

Ingredients made from fiber- and protein-rich pulses provide nutrients and minerals like iron and zinc while also being good for the heart. Pulses can help lower cholesterol and control diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure)   conditions that can lead to heart disease, says John Sievenpiper, associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto. Sievenpiper's research and review of studies also find that eating pulses can help in satiety and help people lose weight.

Ingredion (www.Ingredion.us.com), Westchester, Ill., which produces pulse proteins and flours, says pulses are ""nutritional powerhouses,"" high in dietary fiber and protein and rich in micronutrients. Its Homecraft clean-tasting pulse flours and Vitessence pulse protein-based products can add protein and fiber to cereals and snacks, and are said to be more cost-effective than some animal-based proteins.

Yogurt is also getting the heart-smart green light. Studies reveal eating yogurt is linked to having healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. According to research noted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, ""Compared with nonconsumers, yogurt consumers appear to have better metabolic profile, such as a lower body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, levels of triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin and blood pressure but higher HDL [good] cholesterol. When you weigh less, your heart stays healthier, because it doesn't need to work as hard to carry and nourish your body,"" the research notes. ""The lower your weight, the lower your risk of heart disease.""

A high LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level in combination with a low HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level increases the risk of heart disease. Unlike other dietary fats, trans fatty acids raise the ""bad"" LDLs and lower the ""good"" HDLs.

""The FDA s action in June to eliminate trans fat will help prevent cardiovascular disease and save lives,"" points out AMA president Steven J. Stack. ""We commend the FDA for its decision to remove partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) by 2018. PHOs are the primary dietary source of artificial trans fat in processed foods.""

Companies that make snacks, margarine and creamers, baked goods and refrigerated doughs have been eliminating PHOs and other trans-fats from their formulations for several years. ConAgra, for example, says it began removing trans fats from its microwave popcorn in 2013; Orville Redenbacher popcorn contains no trans fats per serving. General Mills, which owns Betty Crocker and Bisquick, says it labels more than 95 percent of its products as having 0g trans fat, and is eliminating trans fats from many other products.","F&B"

 This is an ideal partnership for many reasons,  said William A. Terlato, chief executive officer of Terlato Wines, in a statement.  Quality has always come first for us, and Feudi San Gregorio has set the bar extremely high on quality. Secondly, there is great synergy with owner Antonio Capaldo and CEO Pierpaolo Sirch. We are pleased to add Feudi San Gregorio's Campania wines to our exceptional portfolio of Italian wines. 

Terlato Wines will import eight estate wines from Feudi San Gregorio, including two Taurasi wines and two Aglianico wines, plus Falanghina, Fiano di Avellino, Greco di Tufo and a ros  of Aglianico. All feature labels are designed by artist Massimo Vignelli.

 We are excited about working with Terlato to grow our brand in the U.S.,  said Feudi San Gregorio chief operating officer Pierpaolo Sirch, in a statement.  Terlato is known for the quality of its portfolio, and we're proud to be a part of it. Since the beginning, we wanted to prove that indigenous wines from Campania can be as beautiful, balanced and expressive as any wine in the world. With Terlato, we're excited to bring Feudi San Gregorio to a larger audience in America. 

Feudi San Gregorio was founded in 1986 in the village of Sorbo Serpico, in the Avellino province of Campania, after an earthquake devastated much of the region, the company says. For Avellino native Enzo Ercolino, it triggered a calling, to establish a wine estate that could help restore the area to its former greatness, it adds.

Today, the winery is owned by the Capaldo family, with Antonio Capaldo at the helm. The winery features a tasting room; Marenna, a Michelin-starred restaurant led by Chef Paolo Barrale; and a luxury guest house.","F&B"

"Beverage market prepares for labeling changes","It s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89511-beverage-market-prepares-for-labeling-changes","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 -0400","NA","Beverage market prepares for labeling changesIt s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration released the new Nutrition Facts label. Among the changes include bolder and larger type for calories, serving size as well as changes to nutrients required. However, the biggest impacts will be an update to the serving sizes to reflect the amount that consumers typically will consume as well as including an Added Sugar section under the Total Sugars section.

Many beverage-makers already have updated their serving sizes, but the added sugars will be a new component. Brand owners will have until July 26, 2018, to comply with the requirements, while beverage manufacturers with less than $10 million a year in sales will have an additional year.

However, this isn t the only labeling change likely to impact beverage-makers. In July, the U.S. Senate and House passed national GMO-labeling legislation. As of press time, President Barack Obama had not signed this legislation into law.

According to an Associated Press article, the law will require most food and beverage packages to carry a text label, a symbol or an electronic code readable by smartphone that indicates whether the product contains GMOs. The Department of Agriculture will have two years to write the new rules based on this legislation, the article added.

But just like the proactive nature of the beverage market, brand owners already are embracing change. The Beer Institute announced a new initiative to encourage its member companies to display specific consumer information on their products, packaging or websites.

The Brewers  Voluntary Disclosure Initiative states beer companies will voluntarily include a serving facts statement on products, disclose ingredients on either the labels or secondary packaging via a list of ingredients, and provide a reference to a website with the information or a QR code, the association says.

Among the companies agreeing to this standard are Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, Heineken USA, Constellation Brands Beer Division, North American Breweries and Craft Brew Alliance.","F&B"

 With sales and net income up double-digits, our first quarter results are setting the stage for fiscal 2017,  said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer, in a statement.  We re off to a great start due to our ability to effectively integrate and grow our recently acquired brands, increase margin across the portfolio and drive consumer demand through our best-in-class marketing and sales execution efforts for our core, higher margin premium brands. We also completed a significant expansion milestone at our Nava brewery, bringing out total current capacity to 20 million hectoliters. 

For the quarter, the company generated a consolidated net sales growth of 15 percent. Net sales for beer increased 19 percent, the company says.

 We successfully kicked off our 120 Day of Summer selling season by posting depletion growth of almost 10 percent,  Sands said.  At retail, Constellation was the No. 1 gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. 

Wine and spirits net sales increased 8 percent, which primarily reflects the benefits of the acquisition of Meiomi and organic net sales growth on an organic constant currency basis of 3 percent driven by volume growth and favorable mix, it says. The U.S. wine business gained IRI dollar share and achieved strong earnings growth and margin expansion driven by high-end wine acquisitions and the brand s collection of  Focus Brands,  it adds.

Consolidated reported and comparable basis operating income increased 29 percent and 21 percent respectively, the company says. Beer operating income increased 22 percent, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and the Ballast Point acquisition. A 17 percent increase in wine and spirits operating income was a result of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth and favorable mix, adds.","F&B"

While reported net revenue performance was negatively impacted by foreign exchanges translation and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, we delivered balanced volume growth and positive price/mix driven by relentless execution of our commercial agenda and leading to solid organic revenue growth. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiency throughout or operations contributed significantly to attractive margin expansion while we continued to invest in our business. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year core constant currency EPS growth objective. 

According to the company, net revenue declined 3.3 percent, due to a negative 4 percent impact by foreign exchange translation and a minus 2.5 percent impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation. Organic revenue, excluding these factors, increased 3.3 percent, the company says.

Reported operating profit increased 2 percent, while core constant currency operating profit increased 4 percent, the company says.

PepsiCo s North America Beverages (NAB) was positively impacted during the quarter by productivity gains, lower raw-material costs, favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals and insurance adjustments, partially offset by operating cost inflation, it adds.

The company reports that net revenue has declined 3.1 percent, while organic revenue grew 3.4 percent year-to-date. Additionally, reported operating profit declined 2 percent and core constant currency operating profit increased 7 percent, it says.","F&B"

Not only was Times Square considerably cleaner, but what stood out, literally, were the towering digital billboards that flashed advertising, promos for upcoming TV shows, events and movies and more.

From the top of a double-decker bus, unconventional advertisements of several beverage brands also resonated. For example, a huge red-and-white Budweiser ad was plastered on the side of a building. With the five-ringed Olympic logo in place, the graphically interesting, sports- themed ad featured male and female athletes playing soccer, throwing a javelin, running and preparing to hit the water.

Another billboard featured the 5-calorie goodness of Bai, proclaiming its  High Fashion Flavor and Thrift Store Calories.  Bai also made news last month as it was the only beverage recognized by New York-based Nielsen as a 2016 U.S. Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award winner. In a statement, Nielsen said it reviewed nearly 3,500 consumer products that were introduced in the consumer packaged goods market in 2014, recognizing 18 that help to improve daily routines, it said. It also noted that it was the first time two start-up companies, one being Bai, were recognized.

Many other brands, like the sports drink beverage BODYARMOR, ramp up interest in their products using traditional marketing such as social media, field and event marketing or by simply having consumers try their products. These tactics seem to be working for BODYARMOR, which is experiencing triple-digit growth. For more information, see the cover story.

Regardless of the ways today s beverage brands are marketing themselves, it s likely that they will continue to use both conventional and high-tech ways to get noticed.","F&B"
"Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipment","An increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89522-beverage-packaging-trends-impact-labeling-equipment","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:48:00 -0400","NA","Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipmentAn increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.

Recently, beverage brands are embracing the idea of personalization on packaging. For example, in May, Atlanta-based The Coca-Cola Co. expanded on its Share a Coke campaign, which featured labels with common names, with its Share a Song campaign, which includes Coca-Cola labels featuring song lyrics. Additionally, the company s Diet Coke brand launched the It s Mine campaign, featuring 12-ounce contour glass bottles with full-body shrink-sleeve labels decorated in myriad designs.

Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group has embraced personalization as well when its Dr Pepper brand launched the Pick Your Pepper campaign this summer. The Pick Your Pepper custom-label bottles leverage unique digital technology in which text, graphics and images can be changed from one printed piece to the next in mass quantity, the company says.

As these types of campaigns continue to prove effective and grow in popularity, labeling equipment has had to accommodate.  Recent trends indicate that it is no longer enough for producers to simply deliver a quality product in a package with a label; consumers today prefer beverages that reflect their individual needs and preferences,  says Michele Morrone, a member of Norcross, Ga.-based Sidel s Labelling Product Management Team.  That is because key contributors to success over the past year or so have been personalization and products that match the consumer s lifestyle. Understanding how to build end-user engagement, producers today need to be fast, flexible and willing to challenge convention. 

He adds:  The popularity of beverage label personalization is increasing significantly, with smaller batch sizes and tighter timing being natural consequences of this trend. This means a challenge for the labeling process in terms of flexibility as customized labels must be designed and produced quickly. 

Bill Hernandez, sales director for packaging at Karlville, Miami, notes that digital printing has been one major trend impacting beverage labels; however, it does not impact the labeling machinery.  The digital print technology has majorly impacted the flexible packaging machinery, but not as much the labeling equipment,  he explains.  For the change to shrink-sleeve application machinery to work smoothly on this kind of printing, it is recommended to use reverse-printing on the label in order to create less friction when the label is sliding through the mandrel.

 The benefits of the digital printing are less time obtaining the material, less scrap ratio, and the possibility for brands to personalize the label faster and use less amounts of material,  Hernandez continues.  Other types of printing in the shrink-sleeve industry usually are offset, flexo [and] gravure. 

Sidel s Morrone notes that the market for shrink-sleeve labeling (SSL) is growing.  SSL offers the potential to reinforce branding and to create eye-catching designs to appeal to the consumer and make the product stand out from the competition,  he explains.  It can combine great flexibility and labeling quality and, in addition, presents the possibility of using all film material types.   The label sleeve can also serve effectively as a seal and, in the case of sensitive beverages, it can be used as a light-barrier. 

Because the sleeve is heat-shrunk, it eliminates container shape restrictions, and removes glue and solvents, making it easier for the PET raw material to be recycled, he adds.

Although SSL is growing in popularity, roll-fed, self-adhesive and pressure-sensitive labeling methods also are common and effective, according to Morrone.

Customization is a trend that shows no signs of slowing down, he adds.  Inventing ways in which the consumer experience can be made more personal is a current tend within packaging, which is set to continue,  Morrone explains.  The introduction of  iprinting,  which allows printing directly onto the bottle, is adding even greater possibilities for personalization. 

Unique, customized packaging shapes and sizes also are impacting labeling equipment, says Justin Slarks, director of marketing for Sleeve Seal, Little Rock, Ark.  Sleeve Seal has been busy keeping up with the needs of manufacturers that are labeling unique bottles and shapes at speed,  he says.  We have machines running at 720-plus [bottles per minute] (BPM) on bottles that require orientation and have tight tolerances on label placement. The trend seems to be stylized packaging that creates a unique look on the store shelves. 

However they re applied, labels have become more important than ever, Morrone says.  [A] label can attract the consumer s attention and encourage them to select one beverage over another,  he says.  So, it s even more important for a brand to stand out on the supermarket shelf. Today s manufacturer, therefore, needs to be able to adapt and change quickly in order to react to market conditions. So, more than ever before, real flexibility within its labeling solutions is really important for any beverage producer. 

Yet, similar to many other aspects within beverage operations, a desire for higher production rates and flexibility is not new. As SKUs continue to proliferate, there s a higher necessity to increase production time in order to quickly and efficiently accommodate product changeover.

 We see a trend toward increased machine uptime and efficiency requirements as being paramount to our customers,  says Neal Konstantin, president of PDC International, Norwalk, Conn.  Flexibility is only second to efficiency. Machines need wide capability ranges and quick, tool-less changeovers from one format to the next. 

He notes that a beverage manufacturer should look for equipment with robust design, which can allow for 24/7 uptime and reliable operation.

PDC International recently launched two new pieces of labeling equipment. Its Conform Series 140F Steam Tunnel has five individually adjustable steam zones, which offer greater shrink quality and consistency while labeling 300 containers a minute, the company says. The PDC R-350 Evolution Shrink Sleeve labeler is a multi-use shrink-sleeve labeler that processes as many as 400 difficult-to-label containers a minute, it says. The system features a tool-less changeover feature and is ideal for thin films, it adds.

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the importance that changeover flexibility has to co-packaging companies.  Flexibility is extremely important,  he says.  Co-packers want robust machines that allow for format changes at affordable prices. Machines that allow simple changeover without retraining operators are invaluable. 

According to Slarks, the company offers durable, highly efficient machines that can precisely label using affordable change parts.  Our user interface is user-friendly, and we offer on-board reference libraries and tutorials,  he says.

Changeovers are one aspect of the operation in which experts note flexibility is most essential.  It is highly important when it comes to changeovers [that] the operator can change in the least amount of time from one product production to another with different specifications,  Karlville s Hernandez explains.  As machinery providers, we need to make sure the changeovers are friendly enough for our customers, like [when] changing a production from a 6-ounce bottle to a 32-ounce bottle in less than 20 minutes. This change in production includes changing recipient, label, [the] type of label application, machine parts and tunnel heat set-up, among other changes. In order for these changeovers to be [done] in the least amount of time, the company should have specific set-up sheets and proper training.

 The automation definitively is important for efficiencies in the complete product line,  he continues.  In labeling machinery, in order to support the productivity of the labeling line, we work [on] implementing automation as much as possible [with] regards to changeovers. Not only changeovers made from size-to-size of the containers, but also changeovers from roll-to-roll. 

Karlville offers many labeling equipment solutions, Hernandez says.  In our environment inside Karlville, for the shrink-sleeve lines we are building and supplying machines that run up to 800 [containers] per minute,  he says.  We offer standard tunnels and dry steam tunnels, which is new technology, together with the Tornado and other tunnels. We also keep up with technology on thinner materials [of] up to 25-macron with materials PVC, PET and OPS. 

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the effects that the proliferation and innovation in automation has had on labeling equipment.  As automation reaches new speeds, the labeling machines need to keep up with the other machines in the line. Line speeds are only as fast as the slowest piece of equipment, so as other machines gain speed, labelers have to keep up. 

Sidel s Morrone explains that to keep up with the pace of automation, main mechanical parts involved in labeling machines increasingly are being replaced with servo-motors.  This is a huge impact,  he says.  The management and synchronization of all the functions becomes much more sophisticated. The information control of the process parameters for setting, maintenance and trouble-shooting is much more accurate. It reduces the need for manual intervention as adjustments can be made via the human machine interface. This also reduces maintenance and lubrication requirements. 

According to Morrone, Sidel offers solutions for many different types of labels, including shrink-sleeves, roll-fed, pressure sensitive or pre-cut.

Looking ahead, experts agree that thinner labeling materials are in store.  The speeds of other related equipment seemed to have plateaued, so the next step is a change in materials,  Slarks says.  Plus, thinner materials offer fewer changeovers, more cost-effective shipping and lower costs per impression. 

Karlville s Hernandez echoes similar sentiments.  The future for the shrink-sleeve equipment is to continue improving the application of thinner materials to lower the cost of the label, to continue to make the machinery smaller and more compact and to continue improving speeds,  he says.","F&B"

"Immunity supporting beverages proliferate","As the saying goes,  a cold is nothing to sneeze at.

According to the survey, 54 percent of employees stated they went into work when sick because they felt the work wouldn t get done otherwise.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89533-immunity-supporting-beverages-proliferate","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:38:00 -0400","NA","Immunity supporting beverages proliferateAs the saying goes,  a cold is nothing to sneeze at.  However, that might not be the case based on a national Career Builder survey conducted by Harris Poll. According to the survey, 54 percent of employees stated they went into work when sick because they felt the work wouldn t get done otherwise. Further, nearly half (48 percent) said that they couldn t afford to miss a day of pay, according to data from the survey, which was conducted online from Aug. 12 to Sept. 2, 2015, and included a representative sample of 3,321 full-time workers and 2,326 hiring managers and human resource professionals across industries and company sizes.

With such a high percentage of the labor force indicating that they are willing to work even when under the weather, it makes staying healthy that much more important.

 The market for immune-health products has seen significant growth in the past decade   both across multiple immune health market segments (sports nutrition, healthy aging, and moms and children) and from a reactive and proactive healthcare approach,  says Donald J. Cox, senior vice president of research and development for Wellmune, a division of Beloit, Wis.-based Kerry s nutrition and general wellness portfolio.  As shown by a 2015 Canadean (formerly Datamonitor) study with nearly 28,000 consumers in over 30 markets, immune health was the No. 2 most desired functional benefit consumers want in a food or beverage. This is second only to general health and wellness. 

Mike Bush, president of Cleveland-based Ganeden and executive board president of the International Probiotics Association, also notes how relevant immune health is to today s consumers.  Consumers are looking for functional foods and beverages that provide additional health benefits, immune support included,  he says.  A recent consumer survey conducted found that out of respondents who did not typically purchase beverages, healthy consumers would be at least 29 percent more likely to purchase new beverages if they claimed immune support. Food and beverage manufacturers are responding with new, healthy products that include benefits like immune support. 

Bush notes that there are a few consumer trends contributing to this shift.  Consumers are becoming more proactively health conscious but also experiencing pill fatigue,  he says.  Functional beverages give them the opportunity to get the health benefits they re looking for in products that are easy to incorporate in a daily routine. 

Although functional food and beverage development that targets immune health is on the rise, there still is much more in the pipeline,  experts note.

 While immune/digestive health products are a large and growing business across the globe, what s interesting is that the growth of functional foods, beverages and supplements may still be in its early stages,  Kerry s Cox says.  This is because consumers  search for products created to provide specific health benefits is a recent phenomenon. Twenty years ago consumers focused absent nutritional negatives (low sodium, refined sugar, artificial sweeteners). They ve since come to accept the presence of nutritional positives (calcium, fiber) but now are seeking targeted functional benefits (immune health, heart health, energy, digestion).

 Driving this shift are consumers who are taking a long-term approach to their health, moving from reactive, short-term fixes to a more proactive, preventative approach,  he continues.  As [previously] mentioned, with long-term immune health at the forefront of consumers  concerns, an unmet demand for innovative products that can deliver proactively and proven immune health benefits is driving the growing functional food, beverage and supplement markets. 

Cox notes that because of consumers on-the-go lifestyles, consumer packaged goods (CPG) that carry an immune health claim will fit in with the current trends of functional products.

 We see interest in the development of immune products spanning across food, beverage and supplement categories including sports nutrition, healthy aging, children s health and stress, including products like [ready-to-drink] (RTD) beverages, effervescent, shots, powdered mixes, etc.,  he says.

With a demand for products that support a healthy immune system, beverage-makers are turning to ingredient suppliers to guide them in fulfilling this need state.

Cox notes that formulation can be a key component of product differentiation for consumers. As such, beverage-makers are asking what ingredients can be used to develop these immune-health products and how they will help meet consumer demands.

 What will lead the charge for meeting consumer demand is a product that includes functional ingredients backed by credible research, which offers simple product claims that resonate with consumers,  he says.  This is because more often than not, many functional ingredients fail to convey compelling claims that set them apart from other immune-boosting products. 

To fulfill this need, Kerry bolstered its nutrition portfolio when it purchased Wellmune last year. A natural immune system booster, Wellmune is a 100 percent natural food, beverage, and supplement ingredient, the company says.

 Wellmune is one of the best immune-support ingredients documented for all life stages and can be formulated into most products,  Cox says.  Wellmune is a natural beta 1,3/1,6 glucan derived from the cell wall of a highly purified, proprietary strain of baker s yeast. Wellmune is a nutritional ingredient found in food, beverages and supplements in over 60 countries globally, is safe for everyday use and has the ability to boost immune function without over stimulating the immune system. 

Most recently, Juxx launched X-mune in Brazil. The juice beverage contains several fruits and vegetables as well as Wellmune. However, brand owners aren t limited to only immune-boosting functionality.

 We get requests not only for standalone immune health products but multi-function products that offer several benefits,  Cox explains.  Whether it is a single benefit (immune enhancement) and/or products offering a combination of immunity and other benefits, combining Wellmune with other ingredients such as protein or probiotics gives product manufactures a competitive advantage within their market by providing more function within a single product. 

Ganeden s Bush also notes the value that probiotics can add to formulations.  Many people don t realize that 70 percent of our immune cells are located in our digestive system, which means digestive balance impacts immune health,  he says.  The immune cells in your digestive tract are exposed to, in some cases, thousands of species of naturally occurring bacteria   both good and bad. It s important to keep a healthy level of beneficial bacteria to maintain digestive health, which, in turn, supports immune health. 

To support the digestive system, the company offers its GanedenBC30, which contains the patented probiotic bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086.  Thanks to our patented and science-backed probiotic strain, GanedenBC30, consumers can now conveniently get their daily dose of probiotics through everyday beverages,  Bush explains.  Research shows that GanedenBC30 is an excellent probiotic choice with immune benefits. When the body is presented with various antigens, GanedenBC30 has been shown in studies to help the body defend itself and support immune health. Multiple studies show that GanedenBC30 positively affects a large number of blood markers in the body that correlate to positive immune modulation. 

Although immune health products are in demand, beverage companies as well as ingredient suppliers understand that the product will only be successful if it can back up its claims.

 In general, efficacy and stability are concerns in probiotic products, so beverage manufacturers should make sure to work with ingredient companies that have the science behind their claims and provide testing and formulation assistance,  Bush says.

To ensure the efficacy and stability of its partners  products, Ganeden performs detailed lab testing that studies the manufacturing of these products and the performance of GanedenBC30 within them, to ensure that it remains beneficial to consumers.

 With thousands of products tested over the years, Ganeden works with its partners to ensure best-of-class stability in a variety of products,  Bush says.

For example, GanedenBC30 features a structure and protective spore that allows it to survive most manufacturing processes, tout a three-year shelf life and transport through the digestive tract, he says.

 GanedenBC30 is a spore-forming strain, and its stability makes it extremely easy to formulate with,  Bush explains.  This allows it to be added into virtually any beverage from any category. Shelf-stable beverages can be a challenge, but we have found solutions to provide probiotic benefits through dispenser caps, straws and other technologies. 

Kerry also recognizes the importance that efficacy plays in its Wellmune ingredient.

 It is quite simple: Successful functional food, beverage and supplement products start with safe, efficacious ingredients supported by numerous peer-reviewed clinical studies,  Cox says.

He adds that when evaluating the efficacy of an ingredient, a beverage formulator should ask the following questions:

For Wellmune , the ingredient has been tested in numerous peer-reviewed clinical studies that have shown its ability to enhance key immune functions, improve overall physical health, maintain healthy energy levels, help maintain health during times of stress and provide immune support as people age, it says.

 Our latest clinical study, which was recently published in the Journal of Nutrition & Food Sciences, demonstrates Wellmune s ability to help keep children significantly healthier by decreasing episodes of common childhood illnesses and symptoms of illness such as upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (URTI),  Cox says.

Going forward, ingredient suppliers anticipate that ingredients that support immune health will continue to proliferate throughout the CPG market, especially beverages.

 There are many opportunities on the horizon for healthy beverages and immune health,  Ganeden s Bush says.  As consumers become more educated on the health benefits they can receive through everyday drinks, we feel that demand will continue to increase for these types of ingredients. Consumers will become better at reading labels, pushing for healthier options with clean ingredients that are science-backed and shown to have benefits. In the coming months Ganeden will be introducing new ingredients that are focused around this specific area and we will keep you posted as we announce progress. ","F&B"

Domestic same-store sales were flat for the July 10-ended quarter, compared with a 7.9-percent increase a year ago.

But the Atlanta-based operator said it continued to grow its market share within the quick-service chicken segment to a record high of 26.6 percent.

As a result, Popeyes downgraded its same-store sales estimate for the year, projecting growth of 1 percent to 2 percent, a decrease from previous guidance of 2 percent to 3 percent.

Cheryl Bachelder, Popeyes CEO, said slower sales were consistent with the sector.

 We remain highly confident that our bold, long-term goals are achievable,  Bachelder said.

Popeyes has implemented new field visit protocols to advance operational improvements, and is investing in new technologies, she said.

Net income was $10.3 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with $10.3 million, or 44 cents per share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter increased 3.9 percent, to $61.7 million.

The chain ended the quarter with 2,594 company-operated and franchised restaurants.

For the year, 200 to 235 restaurants new openings are expected, including 85 to 100 international locations.

 Company targets both urban areas and rural regions after same-store sales stumble

But as the Minneapolis-based chicken-wing chain fills out its market in the U.S., and as same-store sales that once consistently rose stumble this year, the company is looking toward new avenues.

Specifically, Buffalo Wild Wings is targeting urban areas to reach younger consumers moving away from the suburbs, and rural areas where its sports bars haven t reached yet.

In addition, the company is looking at international markets, where it has relatively few locations, but where its potential is far greater than in the U.S.

 International franchising will someday be a bigger part of our growth strategy than domestic Buffalo Wild Wings,  CEO Sally Smith told analysts during the company s Analyst Day presentation Tuesday in Denver.

The presentation comes at a critical juncture for Buffalo Wild Wings. Same-store sales, which had been rising for years, even as casual-dining competitors struggled, have fallen for two straight quarters. That includes a 2.1-percent decline at company-owned restaurants in the second quarter ended June 26.

Investors have started to put pressure on the chain, too. Last month, the activist investor Marcato Capital Management revealed that it had taken a position in the company. That has since helped generate enthusiasm for Buffalo Wild Wings stock, as investors anticipated major changes at the company   its stock rose more than 26 percent at one point in the days after Marcato s filing.

But investors didn t get all they wanted from Buffalo Wild Wings on Tuesday   the company s stock fell more than 2 percent. Buffalo Wild Wings did announce plans to borrow more money and buy back another $300 million in its own stock in a bid to drive up the share price. That comes on top of $75 million already remaining in a previously approved $200 million share buyback.

Executives also said Tuesday that they would explore paying dividends to investors.

 Our stores are generating cash flow beyond what s required for growth,  Smith said.

Still, Buffalo Wild Wings  presentation didn t include any major changes in the brand or its strategy from before Marcato took its position.

Buffalo Wild Wings operates nearly half of its 1,179 locations in the U.S. and Canada. The company has been strategically buying out franchisees over the years when such acquisitions could provide it with a return. And executives hinted that strategy would continue.

 We still think that a well-operated company restaurant can create significantly more profit than franchising,  James Schmidt, chief operating officer of Buffalo Wild Wings, said during the analyst presentation.

The company is also optimistic that it can continue to develop new locations in the U.S., despite concerns of overall market saturation among casual-dining concepts, as well as Buffalo Wild Wings  own recent slowdown.

Buffalo Wild Wings says it can develop another 500 locations in the U.S. and Canada. But the company is slightly shifting from a more suburban model to one in more small towns and urban areas, Schmidt said.

Urban areas can satisfy younger consumers, as well as Baby Boomers who are moving back into cities.

Smaller cities require a smaller box. Buffalo Wild Wings is looking at cities with populations under 50,000 people, where it would build units of 4,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet, rather than the typical 5,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet.

The smaller restaurants cost $1.8 million to open, instead of $2.3 million, but have fewer seats   200 instead of 240   and lower unit volumes of $2.4 million, instead of $3.2 million.

Buffalo Wild Wings is also working extensively on its  Stadia  remodeling program. The company expects to spend $40 million to $45 million a year for the next five years to remodel 60 to 70 company-owned locations annually. Franchisees also expect to remodel locations.

Executives said that the remodel generates 5 percent in additional sales.

The company highlighted areas that it hopes will reverse the same-store sales slip. Buffalo Wild Wings is pushing its lunch daypart, including a 15-minute guarantee, and is also promoting a Wing Tuesdays campaign offering half-price wings.

Buffalo Wild Wings also hopes delivery can ultimately drive sales, while online ordering and to-go business can compete with takeout chains that are stealing some of its sales. The company is testing delivery in two markets, and says its wings would satisfy consumer demand.

Technology, meanwhile, could also be part of the equation. Servers use handheld devices in high-volume restaurants, in some high-cost markets, to reduce labor costs. The company is also exploring menu ordering and payment from the table.

The technology  will drive efficiencies and keep labor flat while labor costs are rising,  Smith said.

Buffalo Wild Wings also affirmed its commitment to growth concepts. The company owns a majority position in the taco concept R Taco, and a minority position in the fast-casual pizza chain PizzaRev.

 We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to be forward-looking,  Smith said.  If we find a concept that has the potential to become a success story, we know how to build restaurants. We know how to build a brand. And we have franchisees that want to expand. 

The two brands  are currently a very small part of our business. But there s strong potential for future growth.

Chris Arnold, Chipotle s communications director, said in a statement the company is interviewing for a new board member and is considering additional board changes  to meet longer-term needs. 

Arnold added that the company is in the process of adopting proxy access provisions, based on results of last year s shareholder voting, which would make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors and seek change.

Earlier this year, investor groups expressed dissatisfaction with Chipotle s board make up as the chain struggled to recover from a series of foodborne illness outbreaks at the end of 2015.

In a letter to shareholders in April, CtW Investment Group argued the Denver-based chain had long outgrown its governance arrangements.

CtW criticized the board s insularity, saying members have had excessively long tenures and were all white and overwhelmingly male.

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also pointed to a flawed board succession process that hasn t allowed directors  skillsets to keep pace with the chain s size and complexity.

Still, in May the chain s shareholders voted to retain the existing board.

Arnold, however, said Tuesday the company is taking action based on shareholder feedback,  as we generally do,  he said.

The potential new board member would join the nine existing members. Arnold did not offer details on what other changes to the board may be under consideration.

The Pok mon Go game debuted on July 7 in the United States, and has since rolled out around the world. McDonald s Corp. officially sponsors Pok mon Go in Japan, where its restaurants debuted as  gyms  for training the game s  pocket monsters  when it launched there in late July.

Nation s Restaurant News asked analytics company Placed, which measures locations via an opt-in audience, to rank the most popular and least popular restaurant brands among consumers for playing Pok mon Go.

The least popular restaurant brands among Pok mon Go players, according to Placed, were Carrabba s Italian Grill, Cracker Barrel and LongHorn Steakhouse.

Restaurant operators have been looking at ways to capitalize on the Pok mon Go craze.

Austin, Texas-based Verts Mediterranean Grill grew traffic 114 percent on a day in mid-July by throwing a Pok mon Go Lure Party.

A survey released this month by MGH, a Baltimore-based marketing communications agency, found that 60 percent of smartphone users who had downloaded the free Pok mon Go game were likely to be lured by businesses that offered player discounts.

MGH also found that 38 percent of those surveyed were also likely to purchase a Pok mon-themed product offering.

Restaurants and bars topped the list of the types of businesses those surveyed noted as offering Pok mon Go-themed products or discounts, while Facebook (72 percent of respondents) and store signage (52 percent) were the platforms from which the majority of players saw Pok mon-related promotions.

The MGH survey found that 56 percent of the respondents who had downloaded Pok mon Go were between the ages of 18 and 29 years old, and female respondents were slightly more likely to have seen Pok mon Go promotions, and were slightly more likely to buy a Pok mon-themed product.

 The best part of Pok mon Go is that it s getting people of all ages out and about; businesses just have to find a way to lure customers in,  Ryan Goff, MGH senior vice president and director of social-marketing, said in a statement.

 With estimated daily users of Pok mon Go still teetering around 20 million, this survey shows there s still a great opportunity for business owners to tap into this unique and active audience to not only drive foot traffic into their venues, but get them to potentially purchase a product,  Goff said.

MGH conducted its survey of 1,000 U.S. smartphone users in July. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 55 years old.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food-at-home prices declined by 1.6 percent overall during the month, compared with a 1.3 percent decrease in June   the seventh sequential decline over the last nine months, the Bureau said.

Over the last 12 months, the food-at-home index has decreased by 1.6 percent, with indexes for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs falling 5.6 percent over that span. The dairy and related products index fell 3.1 percent, and the indexes for cereals and bakery products, and for nonalcoholic beverages, also declined.

Those figures have increased pressure on restaurant chains at a time when many are facing margin pressure because of higher labor costs. As the price gap between food at home and food away from home has widened into a gulf this year, restaurant industry same-store sales have taken a hit. Restaurant traffic fell 3.9 percent in July, according to Black Box Intelligence. And restaurant industry same-store sales slowed by nearly 2 percentage points in the second quarter, according to Nation s Restaurant News research.

The overall food index was unchanged from June at 0.2 percent growth   the smallest 12-month increase since the period ending March of 2010.

By contrast, prices for food away from home increased by 0.2 percent during July   and have risen by 2.8 percent over the prior 12 months. Shane Higgins, an analyst at Duetsche Bank, said the contrasting results among food stores and restaurants could drive traffic away from restaurants and toward supermarkets.

""The gap between prices in the food away from home and food at home channels has been steadily widening for the past several months and is now at 440 [basis points]   the widest level in almost seven years,"" Higgins said. ""As this gap persists or widens further, grocers  relative value proposition should continue to improve, which could help drive grocery traffic.""

"Can McDonald s change its image?"," With a focus on menu improvement, McDonald s shifts its massive supply chain 
 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/supply-chain/can-mcdonald-s-change-its-image","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 16:14:00 +0000","Supply Chain","Can McDonald s change its image?McDonald s has been presenting a brand very different from the one most of us grew up with.

In early August, McDonald s Corp. invited a few dozen members of the media to its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., to share the company s latest product news: The removal of high fructose corn syrup from buns and artificial ingredients from Chicken McNuggets and scrambled eggs.

But the company also wanted to demonstrate a broader menu shift. McDonald s served breakfast bowls made with egg whites, spinach and turkey sausage. Lunch included new salads, burgers made with guacamole, and fries coated with garlic.

McDonald s corporate chef demonstrated how to make an Egg McMuffin. The supply chain director described how McDonald s is working with suppliers to improve offerings and make sure items are more sustainable.

This is the new McDonald s.

The brand is focused on sustainability, the treatment of animals within the supply chain, and providing customers with more healthful options they can feel good about.

 We re about making purposeful change,  said Marion Gross, who leads McDonald s North America supply chain.

 We ve got a committed attitude. We want to be better. We re listening to our customer.

 So over the past year and a half, we ve accelerated the pace of change in everything we re doing. And we ve challenged nearly every aspect of our menu. 

But it remains to be seen whether a more sustainable supply chain will generate more sustainable sales growth. McDonald s is McDonald s, after all. And changing the view of the most well-known and well-visited restaurant chain on Earth will be no easy feat.

 I think it will take years,  said John Gordon, a San Diego-based restaurant consultant.  It will take time. There will always be the pressure on McDonald s to devote time and attention to the core business. ","Restaurants and Food Services"

The campaign revolves around a core of three dramatic  Spoken Cinema  pieces performed by artist Steve Connell that focus on Sustainability, Quality and Family.

 The conversations about food in America have changed rapidly,  said Marilyn Nicholson, Vice President Marketing, Media, & Promotions for Long John Silver s.  The format of these pieces in combination with a robust digital deployment will allow us to tell our brand story in a different way and engage a broader audience with more substantive content. We re hoping to reach that audience with a depth of content that traditional QSR advertising limits. 

The campaign will launch on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and edited Vines with paid flights running into the Fall. All content will be linked to the www.ljsilvers.com flagship website and to unique microsite links for each piece, starting with www.sustainabilityljs.com. The campaign will also be supported by email and in store signage. Budget details of the campaign were not released but the company estimated it would reach millions of consumers with its initial push.

First to launch of the trio will be a piece on Sustainability. Long John Silver s primary products are 100 percent wild-caught Alaskan Cod and Pollock from the best-managed fishery in the world. The waters of the Northern Pacific and stocks of Cod and Pollock are continually monitored and fishing quotas adjusted to protect the strength of the species. Shot on location in and off the shores of Alaska, the piece portrays the beauty and drama of the pristine waters from which the fish are caught.

The second in the series is a piece about Food and Quality underscoring the fact that nourishment is bigger than appetite.  The third in the series is about Family and Food which celebrates the meaning of sharing a meal together and that many people are part of the Long John Silver s family, the fisherman, farmers, owners, and crews who are engaged in bringing quality products to customers. All three spoken cinema pieces can be viewed and shared on YouTube, ljsilvers.com, Facebook, and Twitter.

Spoken Cinema is a new experiential platform that communicates through spoken word, an original score and dynamic visuals. Spoken Cinema is a trademark of Nashville-based GoWest Creative (www.gowestcreativegroup.com), the agency that created the Long John Silver s work. The videos feature artist Steve Connell (www.steveconnellcreates.com). Cincinnati-based Marsh Brand Partners (www.marshideas.com) supported the digital roll-out of the Spoken Cinema work.

Long John Silver s is a classic American brand founded in 1969, and stands today as the nation s largest quick-service seafood chain with more than 1,000 restaurants in the U.S. Long John Silver s is famous for its pure, wild-caught Alaskan whitefish hand-dipped in our signature batter and lightly fried to golden perfection.

The Tuscaloosa, Ala. restaurant, which opens August 16, will be located at 1130 University Blvd.

The new MOOYAH location will be owned and operated by experienced MOOYAH franchisee Denney Barrow and his son, Jordan and daughter-in-law, Carrie Barrow. They opened their first location in Birmingham in 2012 and now will expand to open this University-adjacent restaurant near Jordan s alma mater, the University of Alabama.

 It was important for us to find a franchise concept that still allowed us to run a family business, like we always have. And, MOOYAH was the perfect fit for the Birmingham community and our family,  said Denney.  We have purchased the rights to expand the brand throughout Alabama, and look forward to continuing that development into even more communities around our state. 

The family continued to expand the brand with a second MOOYAH opening in Birmingham in 2014. With Jordan running the operations of the restaurants, his wife Carrie doing all of the accounting and finances, and Jordan s father, Denney, actively involved in site selection and construction, the Barrows have continued their legacy of operating a family-run business with MOOYAH.

 MOOYAH continues to expand, grow and thrive by attracting experienced business owners with strong community ties like the Barrows,  said Michael Mabry, chief operating officer of MOOYAH.  We know MOOYAH will resonate with the Tuscaloosa community, both with families and students, because of our customizable menu and fun atmosphere. 

At MOOYAH, quality food goes hand in hand with customization. Guests get the opportunity to choose from a variety of bun options, from baked- in-house artisan white or multigrain wheat buns to handcrafted lettuce buns, to accompany a never-frozen 100 percent American beef patty, all-natural Jennie-O turkey patty or mouthwatering black bean veggie patty. Each gourmet burger can be customized with five different cheese options, applewood smoked bacon and sliced avocado, along with nine free veggie toppings and 11 free sauces.

MOOYAH French fries come together in a six-step process that takes a total of 24 hours to completely prepare. A delightful combination of constant attention and a little magic help transform U.S. #1 Idaho potatoes into perfect, crisp-on-the-outside and fluffy-on-the-inside fries. Guests also have the choice of savory sweet potato fries. MOOYAH offers real ice cream shakes in 10 delicious flavors ranging from vanilla to Hershey s chocolate, REESE S  , strawberry banana and more.

In 2016, MOOYAH is on pace to open 30 new locations and top the milestone of more than 100 locations. The booming  better burger  brand is set to enter several new states in 2016, while expanding its presence in California, Texas, Florida and New York, as well.

And sure enough, from coast to coast, from Alaska to Hawaii, there s no shortage of truly great steakhouses out there.

We re lucky enough to live in a country that has more varieties of steakhouses (and restaurants in general) than previous generations could have ever imagined. There are the cavernous Wild West establishments where everyone seems to be wearing a Stetson and a pair of Lucchese boots; the power-broker-with-an-expense-account clubhouses; the joints that serve steak at the bar but don t quite fall into the bar-and-grill category; and the modernist steakhouses that turn all these conventions upside down. But whether they re clad in red leather or plywood, d cor is only one aspect of the overall steakhouse experience. When it comes down to it, it s all about the steak.

When Homer  Scotty  Scott and his wife, Janet, were raising their young family, they d summer in Minnesota visiting relatives and frequenting the local Perkins Restaurant which Scott describes as  a highlight of our children s visit.  As a young builder, who at the time was in the midst of a developing a 70-acre residential property in his home state of Wyoming, Scott recognized that Perkins might very well be the family dining concept he was looking for to serve as an anchor restaurant in his new development   one that offered wide spread appeal and that could withstand the test of time.

After pursuing, and being accepted as a franchisee, Scott opened his first Perkins Restaurant in Sheridan, Wyoming in 1979 and the rest they say, is history. Over the course of the next three decades, he opened four additional Perkins Restaurants in Wyoming   in Gillette in 1982; Casper in 1985; Cheyenne in the early 1990 s; and Laramie in 2005. Through years of growth and expansion, during which time Scott s vision was realized, he is quick to point out that Perkins  has and continues to be an important part of our family s success story and an inherent fiber of the local communities we serve.  He adds,  We believe in the brand and what it represents and are particularly proud of Perkins  affiliation with Give Kids The World. 

And it is with this sense of pride that in 2014 Scott and his family started the  Swinging for Smiles  golf tournament to support Give Kids The World (GKTW) Village, a 79 acre, nonprofit  storybook  resort in Central Florida where children with life-threatening illnesses and their families are treated to weeklong, cost-free vacations. Scott remarks,  We are so pleased that we have found a way to contribute to this worthy cause, and can, in our own special way, help with the successful operation of the Gingerbread House, a one of a kind whimsical 300 seat restaurant opened by Perkins in 1990 where meals are provided free of charge to GKTW children and their families each and every day. 

The third annual GKTW Swinging for Smiles Tournament was recently kicked off with a delicious dinner at Scott s golf resort, The Powder Horn, followed by an auction and Calcutta. The following day, 42 two-player teams gathered in the morning at the foot of Big Horn Mountain to tee off in the 18-hole tournament benefitting Give Kids The World. There was an afternoon Derby, as well as an awards ceremony attended by players, local VIP s, Perkins representatives and Pamela Landwirth, President and CEO of Give Kids The World Village. With the combined help of generous donors and event sponsors, Scott raised over $53,000, which is more than double the amount raised in the inaugural year of the event in 2014!  The total raised by Scott over the last three years to benefit Give Kids The World is now over $110,000.  We couldn t have done it without the help of our amazing staff and all of the generous donors in and around Sheridan,  comments Scott.

Thanks to his many contributions, Perkins Franchisee, Homer  Scotty  Scott was recently named as the 2016 recipient of Perkins  Give Kids The World Award honoring his outstanding dedication, commitment and tireless fundraising for the Company s designated charity.

Founded in 1958, Perkins system consists of 398 restaurants in 33 states and Canada, which includes 134 company-owned and operated restaurants and 264 franchised units. With a consistent focus on delivering memorable dining experiences featuring high quality product offerings at an outstanding value, served in attractive, welcoming and contemporary facilities, the Company cites several key strategies that have served to reinvigorate the brand over the past several years including: a system-wide remodeling program, currently underway; menu reimaging featuring more food innovation to appeal to guests  discerning taste preferences; and marketing excellence and value promotion designed to drive traffic and increase sales.

With its strong and growing franchise network, Perkins offers services to franchisees including accounting functions, IT support, assistance with new store development/openings and more.

The brand will also be offering a new Buttercream Frosted Flower Cookie, as well as FRITOS SCOOPS! Corn Chips to pair with the Rockin  Rita chicken salad. All fall menu items will be available at every Chicken Salad Chick location now through Oct. 30.

 Rockin  Rita was so popular when it was first introduced in March that we used up the full supply of Wickle s Spicy Red Sandwich Spread. We re thrilled with its popularity and were eager to bring back this spicy fan-favorite,  said Stacy Brown, Chicken Salad Chick founder.  We ve also decided to partner with Frito-Lay to pair our Rockin  Rita chicken salad with their signature FRITOS SCOOPS! Corn Chips. Because it is the first time Frito-Lay has ever served its SCOOPS! in a restaurant, we re incredibly honored by this collaboration and can t wait for our guests to enjoy the perfect combo for their next tailgate or football-themed watch party! The Scoops will be exclusively available at all of our restaurants so we encourage our guests to enjoy one of their favorite chicken salad flavors while cheering for their favorite team this fall. 

Rockin  Rita is a spicy chicken salad flavor featuring Wickles Pickles Spicy Red Relish, a 70-year old family recipe that is known to pack a punch. Another fall menu inclusion, Strawberry Pecan Salad, features dried cranberries, Fuji apples, strawberries, feta cheese and crushed pecans on a bed of spring mix lettuce with a homemade poppy seed vinaigrette dressing.

The Chicken Salad Chick concept, born in Auburn, Alabama, was established in 2008 in the kitchen of founder, Stacy Brown. When Stacy discovered that the local county health department would not allow her to continue making and selling her delicious recipes out of her home kitchen, she overcame that obstacle by launching her first restaurant with the business expertise of her future husband and fellow founder, Kevin Brown. Together, they opened a small takeout restaurant, which quickly grew; the company now has 56 restaurants across the Southeast.

For more information, visit http://www.chickensaladchick.com. Follow Chicken Salad Chick on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest news and trends.

Chicken Salad Chick puts an edgy twist on a Southern classic, offering guests a  custom fit  chicken salad experience, with 15 original flavors to choose from, as well as gourmet soups, flavorful side salads and freshly-baked desserts. Chicken Salad Chick serves southern style chicken salad from the heart and strives to spread joy, enrich lives and serve others every day. Today, the brand has 56 locations across the Southeast, and has currently sold 146 franchises to be developed across the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana and Texas. The brand was recently named as the top chicken salad in the country to try in the March/April issue of Cooking with Paula Deen, as well as one of FastCasual.com s top Movers and Shakers and one of NRN s 2015 Breakout Brands. Corporate offices are located at 724 North Dean Road in Auburn, Alabama. See www.chickensaladchick.com for additional information.","Restaurants and Food Services"

knows that nothing says  celebration  quite like the fiery-crackle of the cast iron skillet AND the aroma of delicious-smelling sizzling, grilled-to-order fajitas. So now, they re making sure the dish itself has its very own holiday. National Fajita Day will take place for the first time ever on Thursday, Aug. 18, at On The Border (OTB) locations across the country, with fajita specials designed to get everyone fired up about this classic regional Mexican favorite.

 Our mesquite-grilled fajitas always meet with ooohs and aaahs as they make their way from the kitchen to the dining room or OTB Patio   and this holiday is designed to take that excitement to its fullest,  said Ashley Zickefoose, Chief Marketing Officer with On The Border.

The festive restaurant brand s signature Fajita Grill includes a wide variety of savory fajita recipes featuring chicken, steak, or shrimp, or even more creative combos like grilled Portobello mushroom and vegetables, shredded pork carnitas, or Monterey Ranch Chicken with Monterey Jack cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. All are served with hand-pressed to order flour tortillas, and guests can choose from such toppings as sour cream, pico de gallo, cheese, or guacamole.

 Over the last 10 years of working with the brand, I have learned the art of mastering the perfect, authentic fajita for our guests to enjoy.  said Brian Campbell, Director of Culinary and R&D with On The Border.  That s why our fajita entr es make up a whopping quarter percent of our sales. Now you can see why we don t take this holiday lightly.  According to industry reports, On The Border sells more fajita entrees than any other casual dining restaurant.

In fact, Campbell isn t the only one who has perfected the art of the Sizzling OTB fajita. Chef s in all restaurant locations have to be  Fajita Sizzling Certified  ensuring they know how to cut the meat, season it properly and present all guests with OTB-level standards of fajita perfection   100% of the time.

In honor of National Fajita Day, whether dining in or on the patio, guests can enjoy a $9.99 Fajita bundle that includes a choice of Chicken, Vegetables, or Carnitas Classic Fajitas, a cup of Queso cheese dip, and two Sopapillas for dessert. Guests may also choose to upgrade their bundle to steak or shrimp for just $2 more. Don t skip the party, though! This offer is good all day, dine-in only.

 Fajitas aren t just tasty   they re a full-scale celebration,  Zickefoose added.  On The Border has been the spot for fajita festivities since 1982, which is why we re the ultimate place to come for the first-ever National Fajita Day on August 18th. 

On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina is the world s largest Mexican casual dining brand, offering an extensive menu of great-tasting, classic and contemporary Mexican food, like sizzling mesquite-grilled fajitas, and Margaritas as big and bold as the border itself.  On The Border is owned by Border Holdings, LLC, with more than 150 restaurants in 34 states, Puerto Rico, Asia and the Middle East.

Made in the USA and designed for high heat toner production equipment, the Fusion Soft Polyester family of products provide a foldable, waterproof sheet that is stain and tear resistant, and also has STATIC FREE RUNNABILITY both on press and during print finishing.

 For a number of years we have been working directly with restaurant owners all over the country to help them select the best durable paper for their menus,  Al Grant, Director of Sales, Marketing, and Distribution for Fusion Digital Paper , said.

 One thing we ve learned is that restaurant owners love the rich, velvety feel of 10 and 12 mil Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover.  Restaurant owners are passionate, driven entrepreneurs that want and need a unique menu to help them stand out in an increasingly crowded market,  Grant continued.

 But learning is a two-way street, and that s why we created our Bubba s Grill & Grub sample menu with printer blue line captions so that you can better understand the features and benefits of this product for menu applications as well as how to properly care for the menu to maximize its lifespan.  This will both educate the restaurant owner on the capabilities of the menu, but also help manage unrealistic expectations to avoid issues down the road,  Grant concluded.

Grant said,  Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover stands above other digital synthetic substrates for a few reasons.  Our proprietary top coating provides a stain resistant surface, which helps ensure that restaurants will not have to constantly throw away dirty menus.  It also is easy to fold with digital creasing equipment, and unlike polyester films a lay flat fold is definitely attainable.  For commercial printers, Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover is unrivaled compared to top coated polyester films which have inherent static issues on the receiving end of the press.  Fusion Digital Paper s proprietary manufacturing process gives Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover STATIC FREE RUNNABILITY both on press and during print finishing. 

 If you need to run one side and then flip over and immediately run the second side, or want to jog, stack, cut, fold, or round corner during the print finishing phase, Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover are a joy to work with.  Simply put, Fusion Soft Polyester and 13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover will save you time and money both on press and in the finishing department,  Grant said.

Fusion Soft Polyester can be used for single sheet folded menus (10 and 12 mil Fusion Soft Polyester), saddle stitched menus (7.5 mil Fusion Soft Polyester for the inside pages), or flat 12 18 rigid menus (13 mil Fusion Polyester Cover).

"What s in your (digital) wallet?","              This blog is based on the report  Mobile Payments in the U.S.  View the abstract and table of contents   here  .  
  Aug. 10 -  Take a peek at your wallet or purse and what do you see? A little cash? A driver s license? Employee ID and insurance cards? Some lint? And, of course, a nice mix of payment cards? 
 For a card issuer, it all comes down to where their card stands in your wallet: is it your primary card, the one that sits at the top of your wallet the one you grab the most when paying? For many issuers, that s the catbird seat. You don t have to be first to be a winner though, especially if you are a private label card issuer with hopes of driving sales to a specific merchant, where third place isn t just a ribbon to toss in a drawer; or even a cobrand card issuer, where second can feel downright wonderful. 
 Even if a wallet can hold seven or eight cards, some of them can become out of sight, out of mind, hidden beneath the insurance card, never to be used again. A sad day indeed for that card. Meanwhile, mini-wallets today hold just two or three cards giving users reason to bring along only those cards that make the first cut. 
 In theory, digital wallets promise a bigger wallet one that can hold all of your cards, including loyalty and gifts cards (the ones we otherwise so easily lose they never even get into that old-school leather wallet!). This is a boon for consumers, who now can actually manage and manage not to lose all of their cards using them when and where they see fit. And it means all cards get a place in the wallet, a boon for the has-beens and the forgotten. 
 But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies. 
  Cause for concern  
 But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results: 
  Some 48% of adult smartphone users who have used their phone to make a payment at the point of sale in the past 12 months say that they carry fewer cards than they used to carry a result of using mobile payments. 
  And the tendency to carry fewer cards to make payments is higher among Millennials, already a credit card usage trouble spot. 
   Cards are getting winnowed out . Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet. 
 This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:  
  Instead of loading  all  of their cards, are mobile POS payers just loading the ones they really need? 
  Are they defaulting to the card originally uploaded as a part of a corresponding user account (in Apple Pay, for example, do they just use the card originally entered in iTunes)? 
 How do credit card rewards/points factor into using credit cards in digital wallets? 
 Could merchants tie rewards to ACH debit? 
  Packaged Facts     Mobile Payments in the U.S.    wades further into this issue.

"Growth in meat snack sales is not for all products","              Packaged Facts is offering a healthy discount on   Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition  . Purchase the report by October 1 and receive 10% off with code  SNACKS2016 .  
  Aug. 2 -  Meat snacks (jerky and other snacks such as meat sticks) have become a darling of the snacking world in the last couple of years. Between paleo dieters and CrossFitters espousing the benefits of a high protein diet, the gluten- and wheat-free tribes avoiding anything to do with breads, and the continued negative press that carbs have been receiving, meat has come galloping to the rescue for many different types of snackers. 
 However, this has also caused a shift in the style of meat snacks gaining popularity, which is away from traditional simple varieties of beef jerky and towards more complex meat snacks that make use of alternative proteins (i.e., bison, kangaroo, salmon) and unique flavors, marketing artisanal meat snacks that are worlds away from your grandfather s jerky, notes Packaged Facts in the report    Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition   . 
 So how is this shift affecting sales for different meat snack providers? Link Snacks is the largest meat snack producer in the U.S., but is also having the roughest go of it trying to stay relevant in this new snacking world. Dollar sales for the company over the past year were down 7% while volume sales were down 15%, which shows the company has tried to stave off larger losses by increasing prices. If any meat snack brand epitomizes the classic style of jerky, it is Jack Link s, and these sales results show that this is not the kind of jerky people are looking for any more. 
 Compare these results to Krave s, a brand that epitomizes the new wave of healthier-for-you meat snacks marketed directly towards Millennials and which feature unique ingredients. The company ranked among the top eight marketers of meat snacks over the past year in terms of dollar sales. Dollar sales for the company were up 71%, with volume sales up 84%. These results suggest the company is selling more of its 3.5 oz bags of jerky as well as the even larger bags it sells online, but anyway you slice it, growth of the brand has been phenomenal. Oberto Sausage has also seen really good growth in dollar sales through the introduction of its new All Natural Oberto Jerky brand. The lower unit sales growth and much lower volume sales growth suggests the company has positioned this jerky as a premium brand, with a higher price point compared to its Oh Boy! brand. 
 However, let s be clear; it is really only Link Snacks and private label meat snacks that are having a hard time growing sales in this fast-growing category. Other traditional meat snacks manufacturers are doing just fine. ConAgra Foods saw strong growth in sales of its classic Slim Jim meat sticks over the period, although it is clear that about half of that growth came through price increases. Bridgford Foods is also doing exceptionally well with its Sweet Baby Ray jerkies, which pair Bridgford Foods  jerkies with the well-known BBQ sauce brand. The company actually saw a 37% increase in unit sales over the period, higher than the dollar sales growth, but slightly lower volume sales growth, suggesting the company reduced unit sizes over the period. 
 Clearly, Link Snacks needs to get itself sorted in this new market, and the company s recent introduction of its Small Batch and Lorissa s Kitchen brands are a step in this direction. However, its doubtful Krave, Bridgford Foods, and the other marketers are going to calmly wait for the venerable jerky marketer to catch up.

  July 26    Much like people, cats need portion control. They need regular exercise. And some experts even say they really should be in charge of their own feeding schedule. 
 Taken together, these factors boil down to the notion that cats should not be eating from bowls. Plopping a scoop of food into a bowl is not enough! 
 In their natural environment, cats eat about 12 times a day, feasting on small prey like mice and birds that are appropriate for their stomachs, which are about the size of a table tennis ball. They also toss their prey around in a form of play that is essential to their well-being.

July 26   Much like people, cats need portion control. They need regular exercise. And some experts even say they really should be in charge of their own feeding schedule.

Taken together, these factors boil down to the notion that cats should not be eating from bowls. Plopping a scoop of food into a bowl is not enough!

In their natural environment, cats eat about 12 times a day, feasting on small prey like mice and birds that are appropriate for their stomachs, which are about the size of a table tennis ball. They also toss their prey around in a form of play that is essential to their well-being.","Packaging"

  July 18 -  Generally speaking, consumers express interest in new culinary experiences; however, some trepidation remains when it comes to actually  trying  different foods from other cultures. Through innovation, Asian noodle marketers can help bridge the gap between interest and trial, according to Packaged Facts in the report    Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities   . 
 As suggested by our survey results, those who eat Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. The willingness to explore new food options skews higher among those who eat Asian noodles at a restaurant. 
 Once again, this reinforces the idea that restaurants are often a point of entry in ethnic food exploration. So it s not surprising to find that Asian noodle users tend to strongly agree that they enjoy eating foreign foods at a restaurant and often try different foods from other cultures. 
 Some degree of food adventurousness is required to gain knowledge and experience, which can then prompt continued food exploration. 
  As suggested by our survey results, those who believe they possess a strong knowledge of Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. This implies that the willingness to explore new food options and culinary experiences leads to increased confidence and knowledge in other cuisines. 
 Conversely, those who claim they have no Asian noodle knowledge are also less adventurous when it comes to trying new foods/recipes or showing interest in other cultures and foreign foods. 
  To better attract those who are less willing to experiment in food and culture, providing customized options allowing guests to select familiar ingredients will likely have the best opportunity as a point of entry for these new users.  
 Consider the expanding noodle chain Wagamama, which frames its brand as presenting staple modern Asian cuisine delivering fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. The company leverages authenticity while understanding menu explanation is important to help guests feel comfortable with its brand and menu. For example, Teppanyaki is a menu section that offers this explanation to help patrons to increase noodle knowledge and encourage trial:  Teppanyaki is a big plate of sizzling noodles, stir-fried by quickly turning them on a flat griddle. This means you get soft noodles and crunchy vegetables.  
  The bottom line  
 By leveraging limited-time offers, seasonal menus, and other menu strategies that play to variety and change, restaurants play a significant role in shaping society s comfort with trying the new and different when it comes to foreign/ethnic foods. 
 For packaged food marketers, noodle opportunity involves utilizing brand extension, cobranding partnerships and premiumization to gain traction and encourage consumers to explore this type of culinary innovation at home.

"Millennials: Unbanked but bankable?","              Packaged Facts is your trusted source for market research on the financial services industry. We cover topics ranging from financial services for small businesses to debit &amp; credit cards to mobile payments. See our full catalog of related reports  here .   
  June 27 -  Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts    Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers   report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships. 
 Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons. 
 However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century. 
   Many Millennials fit this description .   
 Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models. 
 But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it: 
  In 2008, some 20% of unbanked 18-34s had nevertheless used a bank, a credit union or a savings &amp; loan institution in the past 12 months for some other kind of product or service. 
 In 2015, the percentage of unbanked 18-34s using these financial institutions for something else had risen to 37.5%.  
  These activities could range from obtaining major loans to picking up a prepaid card, getting a money order or cashing in coins. The bottom line is that the theory that Millennials are abandoning banks may be significantly overblown: By one measure, traditional financial institutions are clearly bleeding younger checking and savings accountholders, but by another much broader measure, usage is on the rebound. 
 The question is whether that usage translates to major-ticket revenue in the form of major loans or investment vehicles, steady, incremental revenue in the form of credit cards and prepaid cards, or some other source or merely an occasional piggyback on branch convenience for minor products or services.

"Millennials get ready to bring up fur baby","              See more Packaged Facts reports focused on Millennials  here .  
  June 20 -  The Millennial generation has become a driving force in the American pet industry.  Between 2007 and 2015, Millennials were responsible for 43% of the growth in the number of pet owners in the United States.  The 43 million pet owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group now account for around one in three pet owners, according to Packaged Facts in the report   Millennials as Pet Market Consumers .  
 Millennial consumers will play an even more significant role in the pet industry over the next decade.  The accelerating aging of the American population threatens to shift the consumer landscape for the pet industry because pet ownership traditionally has declined precipitously after the age of 60.  Although aging Boomers will still account for the largest share of growth in the population of pet owners, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in the market for pet products and services.  According to Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data, more than four in 10 (44%) Millennials don t have a pet now but hope to have one in the future.  Packaged Facts projects that the Millennial generation will be responsible for adding 2.6 million pet owners between 2015 and 2020.  
 Packaged Facts    Millennials as Pet Market Consumers   provides important insights for marketers trying to understand the mindset of 18- to 34-year-old pet owners.  For one thing, Millennial pet owners demonstrate an overwhelming urge to pamper their pets.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, they are much more likely than other pet owners to agree  I would rather spend money on pet toys and other products for my pets than on things for myself.   Millennials also are much more likely to  splurge  once in a while on an item for their pets and to enjoy purchasing products that pamper their pets.   So it is not surprising that Simmons National Consumer Study data show that both dog and cat owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are much more likely than other pet owners to buy toys and fashion accessories for their pets. 
 Millennials want pets they can pick up and carry wherever they go.  Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data show that 18- to 34-year-olds are much more likely to prefer to have a small pet  you can take with you more places.   Thus, dog owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are more likely than other dog owners to have small dogs weighing less than 25 pounds and much less likely to have dogs weighing over 40 pounds. 
 Millennials are more likely to coddle their pets when they feed them.  Around 30% of Millennial dog or cat owners prepare home-cooked meals for their pets, compared to just 19% of dog owners and 10% of cat owners in the 35- and-over age group.  Millennial dog or cat owners are more likely to prepare side dishes to add interest and nutrition to pre-made pet food.  Millennials also spend more money than other pet owners on treats and chews for their dogs or cats, suggesting that they especially like to reward their pets with treats and chews. 
 Millennials also appear to be a bit more obsessive about the health and safety of their pets.  For example, Millennial dog or cat owners express an elevated concern about the possibility of feeding their pets contaminated foods.  Besides being more involved in providing home-cooked foods for their pets, they are much more likely than other pet owners to use raw pet food or pet foods with formulations geared toward enhancing the health of their pets, such as organic, natural or non-GMO. 
 Moreover, compared to their older counterparts, 18- to 34-year-old pet owners are more fixated on keeping an eye on their pets.  They are much more likely to employ a wide range of technologies to track the activities of their pets and monitor the status of their health, including webcams, smartphone or tablet apps, collars with a tracking device and motion/sound sensors. 
 In short, compared to other pet owners, Millennials are more likely to be anxious about the health and safety of their pets.  They also are more inclined to pamper, coddle and keep their pets with them whenever they can, while using technology to keep an eye on them when they are away from home.  If this sounds like pets play the role of surrogate children for many Millennials, it s because they do.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, the vast majority (71%) agree that having a pet is a good way to get ready for having a family.  Thus, for many 18- to 34-year-olds owning a pet is part of their transitioning into creating a family.  So, for many Millennials it may just be that looking out for Fido and taking care of Fifi is simply a way to get ready for bringing up baby.

"The big reversal on GMO labeling","              June 10 -  Four years ago, a referendum, California Proposition_37, Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food, was added to the November 2012 ballot. Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural."" 
 As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum. 
 The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills. 
 Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.  
 The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016. 
 The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law. 
 At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling. 
 Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients. Not only will all of its vegetables, fruit cups and most tomato products be non-GMO, so, too, will the added ingredients used as sweeteners. The company indicated that more than 15 products will become non-GMO and be labeled as such. 
 Pointing the way for the other companies that would follow its lead, Campbell s insisted that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. However, the company issued a statement that read in part:  We have always believed that consumers have the right to know what s in their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue reaching a critical mass of 92% of consumers in favor of putting it on the label.  A sample label was prepared to indicate how Campbell would comply with the Vermont law and any future national legislation.  
 Campbell could also have pointed out that not only is there is not great support for GMO labeling, but in fact consumers are increasingly basing their food product purchasing decisions on whether or not there are GMO ingredients present. Packaged Facts research indicates that from 2013 to 2015 the percent of consumers who buy grocery products specifically labeled as non-GMO increased from over 29% to almost 39% while the percent who bought groceries labeled as organic in part to avoid GMO ingredients went from 27% to 35%. 
 Campbell indicated it would support a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging, noting that a national standard  would better inform consumers and would preempt numerous state labeling efforts, which are incomplete, impractical and confusing.

Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural.""

As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum.

The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills.

Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.

The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016.

The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law.

At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling.

Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients. Not only will all of its vegetables, fruit cups and most tomato products be non-GMO, so, too, will the added ingredients used as sweeteners. The company indicated that more than 15 products will become non-GMO and be labeled as such.

Pointing the way for the other companies that would follow its lead, Campbell s insisted that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. However, the company issued a statement that read in part:  We have always believed that consumers have the right to know what s in their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue reaching a critical mass of 92% of consumers in favor of putting it on the label.  A sample label was prepared to indicate how Campbell would comply with the Vermont law and any future national legislation.

Campbell could also have pointed out that not only is there is not great support for GMO labeling, but in fact consumers are increasingly basing their food product purchasing decisions on whether or not there are GMO ingredients present. Packaged Facts research indicates that from 2013 to 2015 the percent of consumers who buy grocery products specifically labeled as non-GMO increased from over 29% to almost 39% while the percent who bought groceries labeled as organic in part to avoid GMO ingredients went from 27% to 35%.

Campbell indicated it would support a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging, noting that a national standard  would better inform consumers and would preempt numerous state labeling efforts, which are incomplete, impractical and confusing.  In deciding to back the labeling legislation Campbell announced it will withdraw from all efforts led by coalitions and groups opposing such measures. It called on all parties involved to come together and help create a workable national labeling plan.

One has to wonder if the Senate had voted to support legislation banning state GMO labeling laws if Campbell and the others that came out for GMO labeling would have done so. By its own admission, Campbell was aware that the vast majority of American consumers want labeling. It must also be aware that the percent of consumers actively seeking out non-GMO products is steadily increasing.

The new data, published this week in JAMA, showed that 2,463 female osteoporosis patients in the ACTIVE Phase III trial, when treated with a daily injection of abaloparatide for 18 months, had a significantly greater reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures when compared to placebo.

It was a little less strong on nonvertebral fractures when compared to placebo, however, with a P value of 0.049--meaning it just squeaked into significance. But it still did manage to hit its trial targets.

Radius is currently set for an EU approval for its candidate by the end of the year, with the med also under FDA review, with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017.

The Cambridge, MA-based biotech is hoping to beat out competition from Amgen ($AMGN) and its partner UCB for their experimental bone drug romosozumab (a.k.a. romo).

Back in March, romo--an antibody designed to block the protein sclerostin--achieved its Phase III BRIDGE study primary endpoint of increasing bone mineral density of lumbar spine at 12 months, when compared with placebo.

It also hit its secondary endpoints of bone mineral density increase of femoral neck and total hip at 12 months over placebo, and BMD increase of lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip at 6 months over placebo.

This came a month after the company posted generally positive results for the med in its FRAME study for women--although analysts were quick to note that the drug didn't perform as well as abaloparatide.

Both are looking to capture market share from Eli Lilly's ($LLY) rival blockbuster Forteo (teriparatide).

 The landmark ACTIVE trial results are important and further validate abaloparatide s potential to consistently, substantially and rapidly reduce both new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,  said Dr. Paul Miller, medical director at the Colorado Center for Bone Research and lead author of the paper.

 Approximately two million osteoporotic fractures occur annually in the U.S., which create physical and psychological burdens for affected women by diminishing their independence and quality of life. There is a great unmet medical need for therapies which could provide more consistent potent and early benefits to patients. 

Abaloparatide works as a synthetic peptide that engages the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1 receptor) and designed to help with bone building activity.

Radius  shares were up this morning on this news by around 1% at 10am EDT, but then quickly dropped into the red. The company currently has a market cap of around $2.33 billion.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sasmar, through its Australian-based holding (its formal headquarters is in Belgium), has acquired all stock in the privately held Aquatrove in exchange for an upfront payment of cash--although the exact amount has been kept under wraps.

 Like many pharmaceutical companies Sasmar is seeking biotechnology acquisitions to bolster product pipelines,  Sasmar said in a statement.

This investment is designed to strengthen its position in the OTC market in health, fertility and reproduction. The pharma co s president and CEO, John-Michael Mancini, said:  The acquisition captures the capability and knowhow built up over many years by the specialized team at Aquatrove and facilitates the realization of our plans for growth moving forward. 

The two companies already have a long history, given that back in 2008, Sasmar first sold an Aquatrove-patented formulation on a lubricant designed to help reduce the risks to fertility while attempting to conceive.

The reverse merger, which more quickly propels the formerly private biotech into the public sphere, has been done through Active With Me--a Canadian company that offers online information on activity-based travel to travelers.

The two are strange bedfellows, given that U.K.-based Rasna Therapeutics works on cancer drugs, but the deal has now been finalized and allows the biotech to trade its shares publicly, with the combined company to be named Rasna Therapeutics.

The early-stage biotech is currently working on modulating the molecular targets LSD1 and NPM1, which are implicated in the progression of both leukemia and lymphoma.

 Becoming a public company is a key element of our growth strategy, and the completion of this reverse merger is a significant accomplishment for Rasna Therapeutics,  said James Tripp, acting CEO of Rasna.

 We believe that this breakthrough program may have significant benefits across all forms of leukemia. Our NPM1 program targets the sub-set of acute myeloid leukemia patients with the NPM1 mutation and may also benefit the general AML population. We are aiming to have a lead candidate identified by 2017.

Shares in the Reckitt Benckiser (LON:RB) spinout surged 15% after a Phase III trial of its opioid dependence drug met the primary endpoint and a key secondary outcome, setting the candidate up to win approval by the end of 2017.

Slough, U.K.-based Indivior is developing the drug, RBP-6000, to free people with opioid use disorder from the need to take medication every day to control their conditions. RBP-6000 is a slow-release injection of the well-established opioid addiction treatment buprenorphine. Indivior has designed the depot formulation to be administered every month, a schedule that could be beneficial to those who struggle to comply with daily regimens.

Such benefits are all for naught, though, if the drug fails to control addiction. The Phase III data go a long way toward dismissing this concern. The trial enrolled 489 subjects with moderate to severe opioid disorder who, while not currently in treatment, wanted medication to help manage their conditions. After an induction phase in which subjects took Suboxone, a sublingual film containing buprenorphine and naloxone, they were randomized to receive either low or high doses of RBP-6000 or placebo.

Indivior tracked the efficacy of RBP-6000 by testing urine samples for opioids and asking participants about their illicit opioid use. After 24 weeks of testing, Indivior found both treatment arms outperformed placebo against this combined urine sample, self-reported endpoint.

As well as hitting that primary endpoint, RBP-6000 succeeded against a key secondary outcome measure. That endpoint looked at the number of people whose urine tested negative for opioids at least 80% of the time. This secondary outcome, which also incorporated self-reporting, was met by both treatment arms. Indivior is content with the safety data, too, although 4.6% of subjects in the RBP-6000 arm dropped out, compared to 2% for the placebo.

The release sent shares in Indivior up 15% in London, bringing the stock s total gains since it listed at the end of 2014 up to 140% and its market cap to  2.45 billion ($3.2 billion). The latest gains are underpinned by a belief that Indivior is now closing in on approval of a drug that can make a dent on the opioid addiction crisis.

 We believe that RBP-6000 can potentially transform the treatment of opioid dependence, if approved, by possibly reducing patients  treatment administration days from 365 a year to 12,  Indivior CEO Shaun Thaxter said in a statement.  RBP-6000 was designed to offer physicians the potential for increased certainty of treatment adherence, and developed with the desire to help mitigate abuse, misuse and diversion of medication. 

Indivior has FDA fast-track designation for the drug, a status that it thinks can enable it to wrap up the data analysis, file and win approval by the end of 2017. That would represent a big boost to Indivior s chances of thriving as a standalone company. Currently, Indivior s business is built upon daily oral formulations of buprenorphine. Now, with schizophrenia drug RBP-7000 also edging toward a regulatory decision, Indivior could be on the cusp of broadening its portfolio.

The company, Xycrobe Therapeutics, has been at the incubator since 2014.

The partners plan to apply Xycrobe s tech, which includes a library of bacterial strains that have a symbiotic relationship living on human skin. The La Jolla, CA-based company has developed several strains of these commensal skin bacteria that could reduce skin inflammation, including in diseases including acne, psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema.

Interestingly, the deal is with J&J s Consumer business, rather than its drug development arm Janssen.

""The current paradigm for treating skin conditions, such as acne, completely disregards the importance of the commensal skin flora. Overuse of antibiotics have led to a higher prevalence of resistant strains of bacteria and along with that comes less efficacy for conventional treatments. So, we are attempting to change that paradigm,"" said Xycrobe founder and CEO Thomas Hitchcock in a statement.

He continued, ""We feel that the key to better treatment solutions for skin disease lies in understanding our body's interaction with the skin microbiome, and how we can leverage this information. 

Xycrobe expects to pursue programs related to various skin issues including hair loss and toenail fungus, but its initial focus is on these inflammatory skin diseases.

Johnson & Johnson has been actively pursuing microbiome-based treatments. It has created the Janssen Human Microbiome Institute (JHMI) specifically to pursue such research. It has research centers in Cambridge, MA and Beerse, Belgium.

The pharma has done some deals on the microbiome front including a pair that are both focused on inflammatory bowel disease one with Cambridge, MA-based Vedanta Biosciences and the other with South San Francisco, CA-based Second Genome.

The Vedanta deal, which dates from last year, was Janssen s first to in-license a microbiome therapeutic candidate.

It s for an indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide; the prior designation is for treatment-resistant depression, which the pharma received in November 2013.

Esketamine could offer another option to treat depression, which is underserved and has seen scant innovation in decades. It s an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist--and an isomer of the generic anesthetic and notorious party drug ketamine. The intranasal formulation offers fast-acting benefits, unlike standard oral treatment approaches.

J&J has high expectations for esketamine, which it listed last year among the more than 10 late-stage products that it expects could become blockbusters with over $1 billion in sales. The candidate was the only neurology candidate in this list, all of which the pharma expects could be approved before 2020. Neuroscience is one of J&J s five core therapeutic areas.

 What we found was again spectacular results where patients who were refractory to most antidepressants when they go on esketamine within days, their improvement in mood is dramatic and somewhat unpredictable,  said William Hait, J&J s Janssen Global Head of Research & Development on a conference call in early May describing data on the candidate.  The duration of the effect is much longer than one might have predicted from the half-life of the drug. So very rapid improvement in mood, not the weeks and sometimes even months to take SSRI or tricyclic. So very rapid and long duration. 

Phase III data for the treatment-resistant depression indication is expected in late 2017. The Phase II data to support the breakthrough designation in major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide was reported in May at the Society of Biological Psychiatry conference.

Hait added,  The study was done in patients who come to the emergency room, they've attempted suicide or about to attempt and someone rescues them. They get admitted to the hospital for standard treatment plus or minus esketamine. And what we saw again, within days, a dramatic improvement in the mood of these patients and a decrease in suicide ideology. 

Ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression patients, a practice that s increasing according to a recent Leerink note based on interviews with a trio of depression physician specialists.

And J&J is not alone in targeting NMDA for depression. Allergan ($AGN) is also developing intravenous rapastinel, which is in Phase III and oral AGN-241660, which is in Phase II, both of which are NMDA modulators. Rapastinel also received breakthrough designation from the FDA in January.

The specialists interviewed by Leerink viewed rapastinel and esketamine as the most promising NMDA modulators to treat depression due to Phase II data showing a rapid onset of action and limited psychotomimetic side effects; the latter is an issue with off-label ketamine use.

The addition of a Brisbane, CA headquarters was sparked by the hire of experienced biotech exec John Donovan to head the company.

Donovan s last endeavor, viral disease play Alios BioPharma, was sold to Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) for about $1.75 billion near the end of 2014. He founded that company and served as its CBO and CFO. Donovan remained with J&J through the end of 2015. He started out as a Wall Street banker, before transitioning to the corporate side with a job at InterMune prior to its acquisition by Roche ($RHHBY).

Tioma started out as Vasculox in 2006 and until now has survived on some small seed rounds. It plans to use its $86 million Series A to advance it lead candidate, an anti-CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitor, through advanced proof-of-concept clinical trials.

The financing attracted a trio of strategic players: It was co-led by RiverVest Venture Partners, Novo Ventures, Roche Venture Fund and GlaxoSmithKline s ($GSK) corporate venture arm S.R. One.

 We find CD47 to be an extremely interesting target in the evolving cancer immunotherapy landscape,  said Novo Ventures Partner Peter Moldt in a statement.  Tioma Therapeutics, with its portfolio of diverse, functionally heterogeneous antibodies, is well positioned to test the CD47 hypothesis in the clinic. 

Tioma aims to treat solid and hematologic cancers. The startup expects that its anti-CD47 antibody approach could have the potential to promote two different aspects of the immune system: the innate and the adaptive immune response. The innate response is an initial, non-specific defense mechanism that is activated by the chemical properties of an antigen, but the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and, therefore, more complex.

The company counts William Frazier, a professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics, Cell Biology, and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University School of Medicine, amongst its scientific founders. He was key in the discovery that CD47 is a receptor for thrombospondin-1. Tioma will keep its St. Louis research labs.

The study will give Astex Pharmaceuticals  DNMT inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy.

In the first phase of the study, CRUK, working out of its clinical trial unit in Southampton, U.K., will give small doses of the DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine to up to 36 patients with advanced solid tumors. In doing so, CRUK expects to confirm the safety of the drug and identify the most effective dose, setting it up to advance into the second phase of the clinical trial. This second phase represents the critical stage for the program.

CRUK plans to enroll 20 patients with bladder cancer who are scheduled to have three or four cycles of chemotherapy before undergoing surgery. Some of the participants will be randomized to receive this standard-of-care treatment. Another cohort will receive the cycles of chemotherapy plus Astex s experimental DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine, also known as SGI-110. Preclinical research suggests the combination could be more effective than chemotherapy alone.

This line of thinking is underpinned by knowledge of the mechanism of action of guadecitabine and the process that causes bladder cancers to develop resistance to chemotherapy. As DNMTs facilitate epigenetic modifications that researchers have for decades linked to the development of resistance to chemotherapy, CRUK is hoping the inhibition of the process will result in tumors of patients in the guadecitabine arm remaining more susceptible to the standard-of-care treatment.

CRUK is running the trial as part of the Combinations Alliance, an initiative that brings the nonprofit together with the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres Network and drug developers to see which treatments work well when given together. In this instance, the drug developer is Astex, a biotech run out of Cambridge, U.K. and Pleasanton, CA, that was bought out by Otsuka for $886 million ( 786 million) in 2013.

Astex has advanced guadecitabine furthest down the pipeline as a treatment for blood cancers--in April it teamed with Genentech for an anti-PD-L1 combination study in acute myeloid leukemia--but it has also explored its effect on solid tumors. Many of the solid tumor trials, like the CRUK study, are sponsored by third parties that want to assess the effect of guadecitabine in combination with other drugs in indications such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.

Other trials for VX-661, its lead pipeline drug, are still ongoing, but it has stopped its combo Phase III study in a small subpopulation of patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a mutation that results in minimal CFTR protein function (F508del het/min).

This comes after an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, which said that the results it had seen did not warrant further tests. Vertex noted that there were not however any safety issues coming out of the study.

 While we recognize that people with CF with minimal function mutations have a form of the disease that is particularly difficult to treat, we believed it was important to evaluate whether a dual combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor could provide some benefit to these patients given they do not today have a medicine to treat the cause of their disease,  said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, EVP and chief medical officer at Vertex.

 These results suggest that a triple combination regimen may provide this group of people with CF the best chance at obtaining a meaningful benefit and we look forward to beginning the first study of a next-generation corrector together with VX-661 and ivacaftor in this group of patients later this year, pending data from our ongoing Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. 

Vertex said despite this setback, it still expects to submit an NDA to the FDA for a Kalydeco/VX-661 cocktail treatment in the second half of 2017, pending data from its remaining Phase III trials. The NDA will include data from the study in people with minimal function mutations, the company added.

Vertex already has a combo CF treatment on the market in the form of Orkambi (ivacaftor and lumacaftor), which has a U.S. license for CF in patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene.

Analysts at Jefferies did not see the dropping of one of the studies as terminal to its CF pipeline, saying in a note to clients,  We believe expectations were low [for this subpopulation], and this does not change our overall positive CF franchise view. 

But Jefferies said that the  (f)ew details in PR or from company discussions make it difficult to have any increased clarity on '661's ultimate likelihood of success in other populations, though timelines for those other Phase IIIs appear intact.

 Vertex is still not disclosing the bar for this interim analysis, so it is difficult to know if any small signals activity were observed, though we believe if there were any lung function benefits worth following up on the study would likely have proceeded to part 2. 

Vertex traded down 3.2% after hours last night when the news was released, having ended the normal day s trading nearly 1% up.

The California-based Scintilla, which has been wholly owned by the biosimilar and oncology biotech Sorrento, is buying into Scintilla's lead program: a nonopiate epidural steroid injectable to treat chronic back pain that is slated to start Phase III trials next year.

This dovetails with Scintilla s own lead program resiniferatoxin (a.k.a. RTX), which is being tested in patients with intractable cancer pain, and is set for Phase II tests starting in 2017.

The merger deal sees Scintilla pay out $60 million upfront to Semnur s equity holders--which will be made up of $40 million in cash and $20 million in shares of common stock of Sorrento.

There will also be an extra cash boost worth up to $140 million from Scintilla to Semnur's equity holders, should its drug hit certain sales and development targets in the coming years.

This also comes after Scintilla penned a deal to acquire Malvern, PA-based SCILEX Pharmaceuticals just last week, whose lead product is for the chronic pain that can come with shingles.

When both deals are formally closed, Scintilla said it will then:  Operate as a standalone company focused on pain management,  with  key members  of Semnur s management team set to take a seat on Scintilla s existing executive table.

Dr. Henry Ji, president and CEO of Sorrento, said:  Upon completion of the pending acquisitions and integrations of Semnur and SCILEX, Scintilla will immediately become a truly unique pain management company with a multiple product pipeline and an experienced management team led by Jaisim Shah from Semnur and Anthony Mack from SCILEX. 

 The acquisition by Scintilla reflects the strength of Semnur's technology, IP and tremendous potential of our lead product candidate,  added Mahendra Shah, executive chairman of Semnur Pharmaceuticals, and MD of Vivo Capital.

 We are excited to join Scintilla and be a part of such a dynamic company that will be a major player in the pain management space.

The report, coming out from Kineticos--in partnership with Ipsos Healthcare and Demy-Colton--asked 51 biotech CEOs across small and large cap companies how healthy their sector felt in Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.

The answer sheet came back positive on the money side, with CEOs marking the  very confident  box when it came to raising capital in the public market, jumping from a lowly 18% marking the same box in Q1 to a healthier 39% three months later.

And 98% of CEOs said they are either  very confident  (53%) or  somewhat confident  (45%) in their companies and the overall industry.

While deal values and deal competition remained stable, those labeling the overall deal landscape as  good  declined for a third straight quarter (45% in Q1 to 35% in Q2).

When it comes to the regulatory side of things, confidence is slowly rising, although it could only really go up after only 22% of surveyed CEOs said back in Q1 that they were  very confident  in the regulatory environment. In the second quarter, this had edged up to 31%.

On top of this, 75% said they expect the frequency in FDA approvals over the next 18-month period to remain stable.

But when it comes to CEOs planning to partner externally, Q2 saw a decrease in confidence (70% to 65%)--although this remains significantly higher than those planning to market their meds on their own (just 12%).

What s the biggest threat to biotech s future? Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of chiefs asked said the largest risk to their business remains getting enough money in to keep going, and comes after several biotechs such as the Cambridge, MA-based cancer company Bind have filed for bankruptcy in the past quarter.

This concern was much higher than the risk of poor clinical results, which was the biggest concern for only 14%.

When asked about the Q2 results, Steve Girling, president of Ipsos Healthcare said:  After a year of surveying biotech CEOs who are leading development stage companies, we've found that early exuberance about the flow of available funds has been replaced by a broader confidence in the potential to bring new assets to market.

 The upcoming U.S. election is likely to have a material impact on the industry, so it will be fascinating to see whether, and how quickly this influences CEO confidence.

It raised $150 million, an impressive feat given that its market cap is just around $450 million. And it did a couple of deals a CAR-T development joint venture with 3SBio and a partnership with Servier to develop a preclinical anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

Now, Sorrento has brought on a former Celgene ($CELG) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jerome Zeldis as CMO and President of Clinical Development. He was with the biopharma for almost 20 years, most recently under the joint title of CEO of Celgene Global Health and CMO.

""Sorrento has an impressive portfolio of unique assets that I believe will clearly differentiate themselves in addressing unmet medical needs in a multitude of markets,  Zeldis said in a statement.  I greatly look forward to joining the team that is growing Sorrento into a leading biopharmaceutical company and using my experience to build a world-class clinical and regulatory organization for the efficient, high-quality clinical development of Sorrento's cutting-edge immunotherapies.""

At Celgene, he oversaw clinical trial development of Celgene molecules. He was the Associate Director of Clinical Research at Sandoz Research Institute and the Director of Medical Development at Janssen Pharmaceutical Research Institute prior to his position with Celgene.

Zeldis was already quite active amongst smaller biopharmas; he is the board chairman at Alliqua, Semorex, and Trek Therapeutics, as well as vice chairman at MetaStat. He also serves on the boards of Kalytera Therapeutics, BioSig Technologies, IR Biosciences Holdings, PTC Therapeutics, and Soligenix.

""His expertise and track record in highly successful drug development will be invaluable to progress the clinical development of our program pipeline towards FDA approval and commercialization,  said Sorrento President and CEO Dr. Henry Ji.

He continued,  Jerry's appointment highlights our focus on investing in clinical development and our steadfast commitment to Sorrento shareholders following the recent $150 million private placement led by Ally Bridge Group completed in June of this year.""

In May, Sorrento had been subject to criticism from activist investor Wildcat Capital Management for its prolific creations of subsidiaries and joint ventures which the investor was concerned is resulting in significant expenditures without offering returns.

Wall Street seemed pleased with the addition of Zeldis, sending Sorrento shares up 5% in early trading after the news.

Now, it s adding to an existing partnership with Bavarian Nordic to start a Phase II combo trial of Opdivo with Bavarian s cancer vaccine CV301 in previously treated NSCLC.

The pharma has said it is looking to combinations, in particular with another of its immunotherapies, Yervoy (ipilimumab), as a way forward on Opdivo in untreated NSCLC; the relatively low 5% rate of PD-L1 expression used in the trial, as opposed to that used in a similar study of competitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) from Merck ($MRK), was also widely criticized by industry observers.

Under the new clinical development collaboration with Bavarian Nordic, BMS will supply Opdivo for a Phase II clinical trial in combination with CV301 to treat previously treated NSCLC patients. The Bavarian candidate targets cancer antigens CEA and MUC1 and upregulates PD-L1. The companies hope that the combination, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, will offer greater benefit than Opdivo alone.

The trial is slated to enroll about 160 patients and will specifically be in patients with previously treated NSCLC--an indication for which Opdivo is already FDA-approved. Bavarian Nordic retains all rights to CV301, which was originally developed by the National Cancer Institute.

 While we have discussed the potential benefit of combining our cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors for some time, this is now within reach as we have once again been able to strike an agreement with the leading immune-oncology company in the world, this time to explore the potential synergy between our programs to benefit patients with lung cancer,  said Bavarian Nordic President and CEO Paul Chaplin in a statement.

He added,  We look forward to the initiation of this study later this year, 

The initial partnership between Bavarian and Bristol-Myers dates back to March 2015--and is worth up to $1 billion. It s specifically an option deal for the former s Prostvac, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeting cancer immunotherapy to treat prostate cancer.

At the time of the deal, Prostvac was already in an investigator-sponsored Phase II trial in combination with BMS s Yervoy. The partners planned to do one or more exploratory combination studies of Prostvac with BMS immuno-oncology agents.

The two companies will specifically combine both meds in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a form of kidney cancer, with Bristol-Myers supplying its blockbuster drug for use in the Phase I/II Aveo-sponsored TiNivo trial.

The early-stage test will be assessed with escalating doses of tivozanib with Opvido, and then be followed by an expansion Phase II cohort at an established combination dose.

The trial will be led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee.

This will be a much needed positive R&D update for the biotech, which has been beleaguered by problems from its VEGF inhibitor for years.

First up in its history, the FDA shot down its hoped-for approval in renal cell carcinoma, calling its pivotal data ""uninterpretable"" and leading the biotech to lay off more than half of its staff. Then, in December 2013, Astellas and Aveo further dashed hopes for the VEGF blocker by revealing that it was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint in a study on colorectal cancer.

Finally, in early 2014, the two shut down a Phase II study on tivozanib in breast cancer when it failed to enroll enough patients, which looked to have closed the book on the drug's last potential indication.

All of this saw Aveo, now known as Aveo Oncology, badly hit, losing Biogen ($BIIB) and then Astellas as research partners before falling into penny-stock territory and being forced to make a series of job cuts.

But the company is, doggedly, still seeking a reprieve for tivozanib, and in December its shares shot up by 27% after it announced a European licensing pact for the drug. It is also continuing with a trial of the drug as a monotherapy.

Remarkably, however, it got worse when the SEC handed down a $4 million penalty in March of this year. The fine came while seeking to ban three of its former execs from leading any company ever again after allegedly misleading investors on the safety of tivozanib.

The SEC, via a court in Boston, alleges that Aveo deliberately withheld the fact that the FDA had deep concerns about the drug in its public statements in 2012 and 2013, and failed to tell investors that the regulator wanted a second clinical trial to address concerns about the patient death rate during the first study.

The firm never did undertake that second trial and it was left to the FDA--which rejected the drug three years ago--to tell the public about its concerns, promptly sending the firm's stock price down by 31%.

Aveo raised $53 million in a public offering of its stock in January 2013--all while failing to disclose that the FDA staff had explicitly recommended a second study for tivozanib, according to the SEC.

BMS, too, has hit a recent R&D snag with its seemingly all-conquering Opdivo, which already has a license to treat advanced RCC patients in a second-line setting.

The drug was looking to bump itself up the pathway in non-small cell lung cancer, but this month flubbed a key late-stage trial, hampering its chances of a first-line setting in the disease. Both will hope to have better luck with their combined approach to kidney cancer.

 The introduction of immunotherapies has greatly improved outcomes in renal cell carcinoma, and combination therapy is the obvious next step in advancing treatment,  said Professor Escudier.

Dr. Michael Needle, chief medical officer of Aveo, added:  This study has the potential to unlock a more effective, better tolerated new treatment approach in RCC. We appreciate Bristol-Myers Squibb s support for this study, and we look forward to working with Dr. Escudier and his team to fully understand this potential. 

Aveo ended Q2 with $39.5 million in cash, according to its latest financials posted this month.

Canadian biotech Aurinia Pharmaceuticals ($AUPH) posted the topline results from its Phase IIb AURA-LV study this morning in a test that was focused on patients with active lupus nephritis (LN), a form of the disease known as lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has a number of subpopulations and complications from the broader condition.

Lupus kidney disease (a.k.a. lupus nephritis) is one of the most serious and potentially life-threatening complications of this autoimmune disease, affecting as many as 60% of people with lupus.

The biotech said that its trial hit the primary endpoint by showing statistically significantly greater complete remission of the disease in patients treated with voclosporin twice a day over 24 weeks of treatment.

The trial pitted voclosporin added to current standard-of-care therapy, namely Roche s ($RHHBY) organ rejection drug CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil), against placebo plus CellCept in achieving complete remission in 265 patients with active LN.

Data showed that 32.6% of patients in the low dose voclosporin arm, 27.3% in the high dose arm and 19.3% in the control arm achieved complete remission (CR), the study s primary endpoint. Patients treated with voclosporin were also twice as likely to achieve CR compared with placebo. But the market has not responded well to these data, with its shares down around 50% pre-market.

Analysts at Leerink said that the stock was trading down because there were 13 deaths across the study, with 10 in the low dose arm of the drug. The company said however that these deaths were due to the severe underlying nature of the disease, and not its drug.

 While this does naturally raise questions, it is important to be mindful that these lupus nephritis patients were extremely sick and treated at many sites with differing practice patterns in Asia, some of which we believe were in much less developed places,  Leerink said in a note to clients.

 The company noted that there were no clear underlying patterns among the deaths, and that one patient (who achieved complete remission) for example had baseline proteinurea of 29 grams, which was the highest value they have ever seen in their entire career of treating lupus patients. 

After talking with the biotech s exec team this morning, Leerink said that it was  incrementally more comfortable that the FDA will view the risk/benefit of voclosporin favorably. 

The firm added:  We believe that AUPH shares would not be trading down so precipitously (if at all) if this were made clearer [ ] All of the deaths occurred in much less developed places including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Russia, and no Americans died in the study. 

It also said on the efficacy side that at first glance, the effectiveness seen in the drug arms  looks lower than what we had expected, but is still respectable. 

The drug works as a calcineurin inhibitor and as an immunosuppressant. By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses.

 We are very pleased by these encouraging results and are grateful to those that participated in our clinical trials,  said Neil Solomons, Aurinia s CMO.

 The AURA study was conducted under rigorous and stringent criteria, enhancing our confidence in voclosporin s potential ability to provide a substantial improvement over the currently accepted standard of care, especially given that study participants had such active disease and were exposed to such a low corticosteroid load. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of improving long-term outcomes for these patients. 

Aurinia said in a statement that it now plans to meet with the FDA at the end of the year to:  Discuss these data and the drug s subsequent clinical development and path to registration in LN. 

There are still more data to be presented, however, and the study will continue through 48 weeks, with results set to be released early next year.

A number of companies are looking into lupus treatments, including Biogen s ($BIIB) anti-BDCA2 antibody that is currently in Phase I and UCB s dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand currently in early-stage trials that is expected to move into midstage by year s end. Biogen also recently snuck in a new lupus treatment, a Bruton s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor known as BIIB068, into the clinic earlier this year.

SLE is a difficult-to-treat disease with a number of variations and subpopulations of patients such as LN--but one littered with late-stage failures.

A few years ago, GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) became the first drugmaker in more than half a century to gain approval for a new treatment for the disease in the form of Benlysta (belimumab).

The drug, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets B-lymphocyte stimulator, has however struggled to make much of a sales impact for the company since its FDA approval in 2011.

Benlysta has a license for patients with active, autoantibody positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy--but brought home just  230 million ($338 million) in 2015. It has not, however, been approved for severe active lupus nephritis.

Other candidates are also in the mix for lupus, including UCB s epratuzumab--although this failed two Phase III trials last year after missing its primary endpoints. AstraZeneca ($AZN) also posted positive Phase II data for its SLE candidate anifrolumab last year. Eli Lilly ($LLY) had been testing its drug tabalumab for the condition, but this was axed in 2014 after it too failed several pivotal late-stage studies.

Anthera Pharmaceuticals  blisibimod, which focuses on anti-BAFF activity in LSE, is still going in mid- to late-stage studies. And in May, a new startup biotech called Thunderbolt was launched as the brainchild of Baxalta, the Mayo Clinic and Velocity Pharmaceutical Development, with a focus on SLE, also via an anti-BAFF mechanism.

The moves see the Roche ($RHHBY) spinout discard the antibiotic 11 months after revealing its interest in the program, and go after a new indication with its small molecule tumor checkpoint controller.

Basel, Switzerland-based Basilea went public with its inhaled antibiotic plans in September, at which time it committed  5.5 million ($6.1 million) to a consortium to hustle the drug toward the clinic. The drug, monosulfactam antibiotic BAL30072, was part of a 5-year Innovative Medicines Initiative that is funneling  50.7 million into the development of treatments for chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Novartis ($NVS) is also involved in the project.

Basilea, however, thinks its inhaled antibiotic is unlikely to make the grade, prompting it to put the program on the scrapheap before advancing as far as Phase I. BAL30072 was selected for the inhaled antibiotic project on the basis of in vitro and in vivo evidence of its activity against numerous multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but a full review of data generated to date has led it to conclude the drug is lacking overall.

The decision marks another blow for BAL30072. An intravenous form of the antibiotic has stuttered through early-stage development for years. Basilea first tested the antibiotic in humans in 2011, at which time it was aiming to have the drug in Phase II by 2013. That target came and went. Basilea landed an $89 million contract with BARDA in 2013, leading to the initiation of a Phase I combination study the following year. Elevated liver enzyme levels limited dosing in Phase I.

With Basilea scrapping the inhaled antibiotic project and the BARDA contract ending after the initial funding period, BAL30072 appears to have run out of new avenues to pursue. But, while a door has closed on the antibiotic, another has opened for Basilea s tumor checkpoint controller BAL101553. Having generated evidence the small molecule can penetrate brain tissue and act against tumors in the organ, Basilea is expanding its clinical development program to include glioblastoma.

The plan is to start adding patients with this form of brain cancer to an ongoing Phase I/IIa trial of an oral form of BAL101553 by the end of the year. To date, the study has enrolled patients with other types of solid tumors.

The topline data from Redwood City, Californian-based specialty pharma co AcelRx Pharmaceuticals ($ACRX) were posted from a small, single-arm, open-label Phase III trial of ARX-04 (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury.

The study--in part funded by the Department of Defense to assess how well this drug might help soldiers injured in the line of duty--saw the 76 patients treated with ARX-04 have an overall mean pain intensity difference to baseline (PID) of 2.9 from a baseline of 8.1, or 35%, on a 0 to 10 rating scale at 60 minutes after taking the med.

The small cap company has not in its statement, however, provided any primary endpoints, and the study itself is very small and not comparative, so a definitive takeaway is not easy to make.

There is also the deeper problem of measuring pain in this clinical setting. In the 2014 paper:  Clinical importance of changes in chronic pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale , authors writing in the Pain journal say that it is:  Difficult to interpret the clinical importance of changes from baseline on this scale (such as a 1- or 2-point change). To date, there are no data driven estimates for clinically important differences in pain intensity scales used for chronic pain studies. 

The drug itself, which is a powerful opioid stronger than morphine and its parent med fentanyl, is a higher dose version of the company s EU-approved Zalviso (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) for severe post-op pain. In Europe, the drug is marketed with Grunenthal.

Zalviso is in fact a hybrid of Sufent--a treatment which has been authorized in the Netherlands since 1978 as an anesthetic-analgesic. But Zalviso, which is a drug-device system, has had less luck in the U.S., and is currently producing new trials after receiving a complete response letter from the FDA back in 2014.

ARX-04, which is used under the tongue through a disposable, prefilled, single-dose applicator, saw its Phase III carried out in two cohorts.

Drilling down into these data, the first part assessed 40 patients using the experimental drug while the second extension phase enrolled 36 adults who could get up to four doses of ARX-04, given hourly as needed for pain.

Interim results posted back in February from the first cohort showed that patients treated with a single dose of ARX-04 experienced a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 2.7 at 60 minutes.

The latest data show that patients in the second cohort reported a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 3.1 on the 0 to 10 pain intensity scale, again after one hour.

Of these 36 patients, 7 received a second dose of ARX-04, and two received a third dose. For 75% of patients in the second cohort, a single dose of ARX04 was sufficient for pain relief and 8% of patients received morphine in addition to ARX-04.

 The Department of Defense, which has provided us with development funding for ARX-04, suggested that we conduct a cognitive impairment assessment to determine if ARX-04 causes cognitive deficiencies, which is an understandable concern when treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield,  explained Dr. Pamela Palmer, co-founder and chief medical officer of AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.

 In addition to putting combat units in danger, drug-induced cognitive effects can impede diagnosis and treatment in a civilian emergency room. If borne out, ARX-04 s onset of pain relief, sublingual dosage form and side effect profile could make it an attractive option for doctors considering opioid analgesic treatment in emergency rooms and field-based settings. 

The ARX-04 Phase III clinical program is made up of three studies in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain.

The first, SAP301, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in ambulatory abdominal surgery patients; the second is SAP302, an open-label trial in adult emergency room patients; and SAP303, an open-label trial in postoperative patients.

The company closed up 5% at the end of play on Friday, before these data were released. It currently has a market cap of just $177 million, nearly half the $382 million it had last March just before it announced the need for more trials for its Zalviso NDA resubmission to the FDA.

It hopes to press the reset button by refocusing on a Roche ($RHHBY) deal that could continue to offer infusions of cash.

But it s still keeping all its options open, considering a partnership, merger or divestiture of non-Roche-related assets. Simply distributing any Roche partnership payments to shareholders is also on the table if no transactions along those lines result.

The Cambridge, MA-based biotech disclosed the Roche partnership this June and stands to receive an upfront of $7.5 million. Then in July, it said it stands to receive a $22.5 million milestone payment from the pharma as the IND became effective for a Phase I study of the partnered ocular disease candidate EBI-031, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds interleukin-6 and inhibits IL-6 cytokine signaling.

All this will be considered at an upcoming Aug. 15 shareholder meeting, including a final ratification of the Roche partnership. Eleven shares gained more than 10% in early trading on Aug. 12 to hit a meager market cap of about $90 million.

 We look forward to closing our licensing deal with Roche, contingent upon the approval of our stockholders at our upcoming stockholder meeting,  said Eleven CEO Abbie Celniker in a statement.

The EBI-031 IND covers Phase I clinical trials in diabetic macular edema (DME) and uveitis. Roche can buy out rights to the drug at a couple of points in its development, paying $135 million after a Phase II trial start but before Phase III, or $265 million before a regulatory filing is accepted for review.

If Roche doesn t buy EBI-031 from Eleven but continues with the partnership instead, the biotech stands to receive a total of $262.5 million in milestone payments along the way including $20 million on a Phase II start, $30 million on a Phase III start, $25 million on a U.S. regulatory filing, and $40 million on a U.S. launch. Eleven also stands to get 7.5% to 15% on net sales of any products containing EBI-031, a rate that escalates annually over a four-year period.

Eleven was founded in 2010 by Flagship Ventures and Third Rock Ventures as an ambitious effort to engineer protein therapeutics to address a wide variety of disorders including inflammatory conditions and coagulation disorders. It raised $55 million in venture capital.

Six years later, Third Rock and Flagship are still the main shareholders in the company, even after a mediocre IPO in 2014 that raised $50 million. Third Rock held 24.2% at June 30, while Flagship held 16.8%.

The Californian biotech, formerly known as Arrowhead Research, said it had raised the cash through a series of investors, including that perennial life sciences Orbimed, as well as RA Capital Management, Perceptive Advisors, RTW Investments and others.

The company is working on developing gene silencing techniques, with a number of its RNAi assets bought from Novartis in a $35 million deal that saw it grab the rights to three preclinical candidates.

In 2011, it bought out Roche s ($RHHBY) RNAi platform as this tech moved out of Big Pharma and into smaller biotech.

Arrowhead has for some time been locked in a rivalry with fellow RNAi specialist Alnylam ($ALNY) to get their RNAi meds onto the market first.

It s been a long time coming given that gene silencing as a concept garnered the Nobel prize a decade ago, but has lingered on the fringe of commercialization ever since then.

But there is much promise here as analysts have forecast that RNA-based therapies could generate $1.2 billion in revenue by the decade s end.

Last year, Arrowhead also posted positive data for its hepatitis B virus candidate and is also currently working on treating the genetic disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

After ditching its blood cancer trials for PNT2258 back in June, it has now walked away entirely from its development. But the biotech is looking for a quick turnaround with a newly licensed drug.

This new treatment, a Cdc7 inhibitor known as PNT141, was licensed during the last quarter and the Canadian biotech said it would start early work on the candidate right away, which will focus on as-yet-undisclosed oncology targets.

This drug is a real lifeboat to the biotech, as just two months ago, ProNAi had to halt Phase II trials of its lead drug PNT2258 in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma given its  modest efficacy.  The drug s future was in the balance while the biotech assessed whether it should go forward in other indications.

Today, however, the Vancouver-based company has decided to cut and run, and refocus its efforts on its new experimental med.

In a statement released alongside its second quarter results, ProNAi said:  No further investment in PNT2258 or the underlying DNAi platform by ProNAi is contemplated and the company subsequently has closed its research facility based in Plymouth, Michigan, which supported these programs. 

Dr. Nick Glover, president and CEO of ProNAi Therapeutics, was keen to move on from its dropping of PNT2258 by talking about his new treatment.

 Our goal is to build a broad pipeline consisting primarily of assets that leverage discoveries on the leading edge of cancer biology,  he said in a statement.  PNT141 highlights this strategy as Cdc7 has a central function in both DNA replication and DNA damage response, two mechanisms that are increasingly recognized as having critical roles in driving cancer. In addition to toxicology and manufacturing work, we are conducting a robust preclinical assessment of PNT141 aimed at further informing our clinical development plans and patient selection strategies as we prepare this product candidate for clinical trials. 

As of June 30, 2016, ProNAi had $130.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $150.2 million at the end of last year.

The company, which saw its shares nosedive on the Phase II data back in June, ended the day up 1% at the close of trading. It has a market cap of just $57 million.","Pharmaceuticals"

The data suggest Zealand s pen achieves clinically relevant increases in plasma glucose in comparable times to GlucaGen, but, notably, its longer shelf life supports ready-to-use formulations.

Copenhagen, Denmark-based Zealand enrolled 81 Type 1 diabetics in the study and gave them single doses of ZP4207, its glucagon peptide analog, or Novo s GlucaGen following an insulin-induced hypoglycemic event. The trial assessed a variety of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic endpoints, such as time to peak plasma glucose concentration. From the limited, selected look at the data shared by Zealand in its release, ZP4207 held its own against GlucaGen.

The three highest doses of ZP4207 triggered blood glucose concentrations of 70 mg/dl or more in the 30 minutes following administration. GlucaGen also hit this target. ZP4207 matched up to GlucaGen in terms of the time it took to increase plasma glucose to 20 mg/dl, a level Zealand views as being clinically relevant. Taking the median of the dataset, the experimental therapy and GlucaGen both drove plasma levels up past 20 mg/dl in 9 to 10 minutes. Safety was similarly comparable.

That is all the information Zealand has released for now. Zealand intends to publish the full Phase II data in the future but, as it stands, is yet to share details of how ZP4207 performed against the majority of the 15 PK/PD outcome measures assessed in the trial, including all of those designated as primary in the protocol. Zealand SVP Hanne Leth Hillman told FierceBiotech how the outcomes came to be selected for inclusion in the top-line release.

""We have chosen to inform of the outcome on those of them that we consider to have main clinical relevance for the therapeutic potential of our analog in a hypoglycemia rescue setting, and save information on the outcome on all other parameters until we have analyzed the full Phase II data set and discussed them with the FDA,"" Hillman said.

Zealand, which has been upfront about negative data in the past, thinks the results add to evidence of the attractive profile of ZP4207. Armed with the data, Zealand now plans to talk to FDA to define how to take ZP4207 forward, a process it sees leading to Type 1 diabetics gaining access to a more convenient way to treat severe hypoglycemia.

 With the current results we believe to be one step closer to being able to offer insulin dependent diabetes patients a ready-to-use pen for convenient and fast rescue from severe hypoglycemia--or insulin shock,  Zealand Chief Development and Medical Officer Adam Steensberg said in a statement.  We see a clear need for a patient friendly rescue product and we look forward to the next step in development. 

The appeal of ZP4207, which is now also known as dasiglucagon, lies in its shelf life. GlucaGen is sold as a powder, a form that means it must be dissolved in an accompanying solvent prior to administration. By creating a glucagon peptide analog stable enough to be kept in a liquid solution, Zealand thinks it can provide diabetics with a rescue pen that is ready to use. The drug is also central to the artificial pancreas Zealand is working on with Beta Bionics.

Following the failure of its cardiac reperfusion injury drug in Phase II earlier this year, ZP4207 is the most advanced candidate in Zealand s in-house pipeline. The company is best known for its alliance with Sanofi ($SNY), in particular the GLP-1 peptide agonist Adlyxin.

Under the deal, exact financial details of which were not made public by either party, Zymeworks will pay an undisclosed tech licensing fee to get hold of ITS s HuTARG drug discovery platform.

There was a little color on the money side, with the companies saying in a statement that ITS will receive up to $65 million in clinical and commercial milestones and low, single-digit royalties on net sales of any meds they manage to make and market.

HuTARG works as a protein engineering platform and is, according to ITS, the first fully mammalian tech that generates antibody diversity in vitro via RAG1/RAG2 mediated V(D)J recombination.

This, it says, helps it create  highly potent protein-based biologics.  Further explanation and therapy area targets were also not disclosed, although Zymeworks said its use of HuTARG would be  directed towards challenging disease targets. 

Ali Tehrani, president and CEO of Zymeworks, said:  We view the HuTARG platform as a leading technology for the discovery and generation of therapeutic antibodies. This further strengthens our in-house antibody discovery capabilities and accelerates the development of Zymeworks  novel bi-specific and multi-functional biologics and drug conjugates. 

Michael Gallo, president of Innovative Targeting Solutions, added:  Zymeworks is a leader in the development of innovative biotherapeutics. Together with our first-in-class protein engineering technology, they will be able to discover novel medicines that can transform the lives of people with grievous illnesses. 

Zymeworks has enjoyed 2016, having at the start of the year bagged a $61.5 million mezzanine round with an eye to following up with an IPO. It already has deals with the Big Pharma likes of Eli Lilly ($LLY) and Celgene ($CELG), as well as with Merck ($MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK).

In fact, back in April GSK doubled down on its existing deal with the Canadian biotech on a research deal that could be worth just shy of $1 billion, if everything goes well.

Most of Big Pharma s interest has revolved around its Azymetric bispecific drug platform. This bispecific approach doubles up on a drug s potential target, offering a complementary approach to its Efect platform, a library of antibody Fc modifications that can be used to orchestrate an immune response--either turning it up or tamping it down.

By adding the HuTARG platform to its arsenal, the biotech will hope to expand its attractiveness for further deals and complement its existing drug discovery IP.

The idea is to use the microbiome to help improve the efficacy of this major developing class of oncology drugs as well as, potentially, for standalone use to treat cancer.

The news comes after the PureTech Health-founded company raised $50 million earlier this summer to advance microbiome therapeutics into the clinic during the first half of next year to treat undisclosed infectious and autoimmune diseases.

The oncologists in the collaboration will be led by Dr. Jeffrey Weber, who is the deputy director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone.

 Dr. Weber is a pioneer in translational research, particularly in immunotherapy and the development of checkpoint inhibitors,  said Vedanta CSO Bruce Roberts in a statement.  We look forward to working with Dr. Weber to expand Vedanta s portfolio of immune activating microbial cocktails for use in standalone immunotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. 

This foray specifically to extend its reach into oncology comes just as microbiome therapeutics research has hit an early snag. Competitor Seres Therapeutics ($MCRB) failed in a recent Phase II test of an oral microbiome therapeutic, SER-109, to reduce the risk of Clostridium difficile infection, a much more obviously microbiome-related indication.

The NYU deal specifically explores the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in cancer treatment. The expectation is that human gut bacteria can be used to create immunotherapies, based on work including a recent publication in the scientific journal Cell by Vedanta co-founder Dr. Kenya Honda.

 Checkpoint inhibitors are a major advance in cancer therapy, but many patients do not respond to therapy, and some patients who respond will eventually relapse,  said Weber in the statement.  Recent data suggest an important role for the microbiome in the anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy, and our other studies of the microbiome will offer interesting new clinical insights into how and why these treatments work.

Gedeon Richter has some inkling of what the companies are going through. The Hungarian drug developer posted negative Phase III data on its Allergan-partnered depression drug, marking another setback in the turbulent history of the program. Genmab committed to a further escalation of its R&D spending, setting the company up to hustle a clutch of cancer programs into the clinic over the coming 18 months. And the Danish drugmaker then rounded out the week by unveiling a deal with Gilead. The Big Biotech will use Genmab s bispecific platform for a HIV program. And more. Nick Taylor

The net asset value of Neil Woodford s Patient Capital Trust fell 10.8% over the first 6 months of the year as Circassia s (LON:CIR) late-phase flop and the ongoing decline of Northwest Biotherapeutics ($NWBO) hit home. But Woodford is holding his nerve, trimming his position in relative safe havens such as AstraZeneca ($AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) to pump more money into early-stage firms.

Gilead ($GILD) has struck a deal to access bispecific antibody technology from Genmab (CPH:GEN). The agreement gives Gilead an exclusive license to use the Danish drugmaker s bispecific platform to create an HIV therapeutic, plus an option to take up another exclusive license on the technology.

Genmab (CPH:GEN) is looking to build on the success of its Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)-partnered drug Darzalex by upping its R&D spending. The plan is to increase operating expenses by 40% or more this year to position a CD3-CD20 bispecific antibody and a clutch of other early-stage programs to barrel into the clinic over the next 18 months.

4. Allergan and Richter push ahead despite PhIII fail for depression drug

Allergan ($AGN) and Gedeon Richter (BUX:RICHTER) have reported negative data from a Phase III trial of cariprazine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The data continue the turbulent history of cariprazine, which was originally rejected by the FDA in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder before later winning over the regulator.

Motif Bio (LON:MTFB) is the latest biotech to have its Nasdaq IPO hopes crushed by an unreceptive market. The late-phase antibiotic player aimed to secure $26 million ( 23 million) from new investors and $9 million from an existing backer, but this relatively modest ambition has proven to be beyond its reach.

There would still be limitations to the lottery as a funding source, the Advertiser reported, including that revenue from it wouldn't be available until at least 2018 and that with lottery revenue typically being flat year to year, it won't keep up with rising healthcare costs and the state's General Fund could expect to face another fiscal crisis a few years down the road.

While the carrier as early as April continued to believe the exchanges were a good investment of resources, Monday found Bertolini singing a different tune,  Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""

The company noted its new Arkansas ACO is also supported by the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. (AFMC), a quality improvement organization that will provide knowledge of the local healthcare landscape and guidance to the ACO practices.

 At a time when regulation and consolidation are making it harder for independent physicians to deliver quality, personalized care to the communities they serve, Aledade offers a new model of primary care that puts physicians back where they should be: quarterbacking their patients  health care,  Mostashari stated.

Aledade highlights that the model also provides physicians with ""unparalleled"" regulatory expertise, best practices from a national network of primary care physicians, and face-to-face practice transformation support. Some of the Arkansas ACO practices also aim to participate in CMS  new Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) initiative, the company said.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Gonzalez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and make false statements in connection with a federal health care benefit program, the DOJ reported, adding sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 24, 2016.

DOJ spokesman Peter Carr told Modern Healthcare in June that about half of the DOJ's current healthcare fraud caseload centers on home health agencies, with many such cases involving claims for treatments that were either unnecessary, not actually provided, or kickbacks for referrals.

In addition, about 5% of home health agencies nationwide show signs of potentially fraudulent activity, according to an HHS Office of Inspector General alert, Modern Healthcare reported.

Research has consistently demonstrated a wage gap between men and women and it has consistently been accompanied by theories attempting to explain this disparity. According to the study authors, these theories often suggest the wage gap exists because women work fewer hours, are less productive, or undervalue the services they provide but they have generally been based on analyses of data that are susceptible to bias or that fail to account for confounding variables.

Researchers also used data from the  Physicians Foundation Annual Report  and The Washington Post to make determinations about number of hours worked, number of services provided, and overall experience.

Prior to adjusting for these factors, female providers were reimbursed an average of $34,126 less than their male counterparts. After adjusting for these factors, female providers were reimbursed an average of $18,677 less. A wage gap existed across 13 specialties examined.

These results are consistent with similar investigations of the wage gap in healthcare. In fact, the wage gap may even be getting worse. Male physicians beginning their career in New York earned $16,819 more than their female counterparts in 2008. In 1999, they had only earned $3,600 more.

Researchers did not pose their own theory to explain the wage gap, but they concluded that  the commonly held theories of why monetary disparities exist need to be revisited.

The settlement ends a three-year-long legal battle over Health First s market control, although it surely isn t the last as an increasing numbers of integrated health systems bring hospitals, physicians and health plans under one umbrella.

Allegations against Health First stemmed from its 2013 acquisition of Melbourne Internal Medicine Associates, a large physician group operating in Brevard County, FL. Plaintiffs argued this move created an illegal monopoly that decreased competition. During opening statements, Richard Arnold, an attorney for the plaintiffs, explained that Health First controlled 86% of acute hospital services, 27% of physicians and 14.4% of health insurance in the local market.

Health First used its market control to unfairly influence referral patterns by pressuring physicians to refer patients almost exclusively to Health First hospitals and specialists, according to allegations. Those who didn t play along lost admitting privileges to Health First hospitals and were denied contracts with Health First health plans.  It is thus impossible to meaningfully participate in any healthcare-related market in Southern Brevard County without doing business with Health First and, more importantly, on Health First s terms,  plaintiffs claimed.

Details of the settlement have not been released, although financial claims against Health First have been settled. Plaintiff OMNI Healthcare also issued a statement declaring,  The plaintiffs and Health First have agreed to mediate a number of non-financial demands in an effort to improve healthcare in Brevard County. 

Health First is no stranger to complaints that it engages in unfair business practices. It won an earlier lawsuit brought by OMNI Healthcare in 2008 and the most recent antitrust lawsuit was dismissed twice before proceeding to trial.

While approval times have dramatically decreased, Avalere Health argues that the $300 million in unspent fees should be used to accelerate approval timelines further.

""The significant unspent funds left over from user fee programs suggest that FDA could do more to accelerate product reviews,"" Jay Jackson, manager at Avalere, said in a statement. ""Particularly with public concern around drug prices, speeding approval of the second-to-market products can increase competition that may result in lower net prices.""

There are currently multiple types of prescription drug user fees, including product fees that are paid for marketed products; establishment fees that are paid by all manufacturers annually; and application review fees that are paid when an application is submitted.

Fees have been steadily rising. In 2016, a prescription drug application that includes clinical data has an application fee of more than $2.3 million to the FDA.

45 novel drugs were approved in 2015, significantly more than in previous years when the average number of novel drugs approved was 28.

"Ipsen hopes to be David to Allergan's Goliath"," The French biotech is hoping a new indication for its boulinum toxin Dysport will allow it to compete more effectively with Allergan's market-leading Botox.&nbsp; ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/ipsen-hopes-to-be-david-to-allergans-goliath/424645/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 13:51:39 -0400","NA","Ipsen hopes to be David to Allergan's GoliathIpsen hopes to be David to Allergan's Goliath

Earlier this month, Ipsen s Dysport (abotulinumtoxinA) was approved for the treatment of lower limb spasticity in pediatric patients over two years old, making it the first, and currently the only, FDA-approved botulinum toxin product for treatment in children with lower limb spasticity associated with cerebral palsy. Ipsen is one of three companies, including Allergan and Merz GmbH, which market botulinum toxin-based injectables for therapeutic and aesthetic uses.

You may be more familiar with the blockbuster wrinkle reducer Botox. While Allergan's Botox is the most widely-known and successful  each company has attempted to carve out its own niche in specific target markets. Ipsen is hoping that the latest indication for Dysport will set it up to compete with Botox in a more meaningful way.

Privately-held Merz has focused most of its marketing efforts for Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) in Europe. However, Ipsen is expanding beyond its French roots and aggressively expanding its presence in the U.S., while remaining true to its longstanding focus on pediatric therapeutics.

""What we re most excited about is that we now have an approval for this indication for a population that is underserved and still has tremendous unmet medical needs,"" says David Cox, Ipsen's VP of medical & regulatory affairs.

Allergan and Merz each have an ongoing clinical study evaluating the use of their product in treatment of lower limb spasticty in children with cerebral palsy.  Allergan s Phase 3 study was initiated in July 2012, with an expected completion date of May 2017.  Merz s study, XEMEC, is a comparative study evaluating Xeomin versus Botox in this population.  XEMEC is focused on children between the ages of 2 and 12, with a planned completion date of December 2016.

Allergan s Botox was approved for its first indication in 1989 for an aesthetic application. Since then, the company has racked up numerous therapeutic approvals for Botox, including treatment of migraine, cervical dystonia, upper and lower limb spasticity in adults and overactive bladder (OAB), amongst others.

For the second quarter of 2016, Botox generated roughly $780 million in revenues, including $323 million on the cosmetic side and $381 million on the therapeutic side.  Allergan has seen a lot of growth on the therapeutic side mainly in the areas of migraine and OAB, where it continues to focus its marketing efforts.

Merz s earnings are not disclosed; however, Xeomin has only three FDA approvals, including blepharospasm, cervical dystonia and adult upper limb spasticity.

Last year Ipsen saw global sales of Dysport increase 9.7% to  279.5 million ($315.2 million), driven mainly by performance on the cosmetic side in the Russian, Brazilian, Mexican and Australian markets. However, given the latest approval in the U.S., the company is hoping to see increased sales in the pediatric therapeutic market, allowing it to take on the giant that is Botox.

Prevalence estimates vary widely, but in the U.S. about 500,000 children are living with cerebral palsy. According to Cox, roughly 77% of all patients with cerebral palsy have some type of spasticity and require treatment for it. In the case of lower limb spasticity, botulinum toxin treatments are used to reduce muscle tone (which is exaggerated in patients with cerebral palsy), and improve function and gait.

For some time, adults with spasticity have had approved treatment options for spasticity. Botox is approved for upper and lower limb spasticity, and Xeomin is approved for upper limb spasticity both in adults only. Dysport was approved for treatment of upper limb spasticity in adults in July 2015. However, gaining approval for lower limb spasticity in the pediatric population has been challenging due to dosing issues.

""For this type of medicine, we really wanted to know how long this medicine was going to work, and at which doses. We needed to know when to re-treat, because we want the kids to need as few injections as possible,"" Cox explained.

These issues were carefully evaluated in Ipsen s randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 235 pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and dynamic eqinus foot deformity.  In this global study, investigators evaluated the effects of three different doses of Dysport using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) as a primary endpoint, and the Physician s Global Assessment as a secondary endpoint. In addition, the team used the Tardieu scale, which assesses changes in range of motion. The study was published in Pediatrics in January.

After four weeks, there were statistically significant improvements across the board, with a high level of tolerability and significantly improved function. The researchers also determined that pediatric patients treated with the doses studied would not need to be re-treated for 16 to 22 weeks.

""This is the largest study of its kind, and it s a landmark study,"" Cox said. ""We were able to validate dosing in a pediatric population in the context of a Phase 3, registration-quality study.""

Potential dangers of off-label use in children

While off-label use in this population hasn't been uncommon, it poses its own set of risks. Instead of definitive evidence, physicians have often relied on experience and available guidance to determine how much to dose. Dosing in this population can be especially challenging because of children s low weight, combined with the fact that treating spasticity requires much higher dosing than using botulinum toxin for getting rid of wrinkles.

The medical literature is full of case studies showing that Botox injections have helped children with cerebral palsy walk for the first time and function in a way that their parents never thought possible. However, there are also numerous reports of children who have been overdosed with botulinum toxin, including a seven-year-old girl from Texas, whose parents attributed her death from respiratory failure in 2007 to Botox after she received a series of injections to treat lower-limb spasticity.

Ipsen is hoping to change this trend with its first-to-market treatment.

Keeping these warnings and tragedies in mind, Ipsen is putting a strong focus on the patients. ""Now that we have completed this landmark trial and been approved for this indication, we can partner with the community. We can also communicate clearly with medical professionals and payers, and provide education,"" said Cox.","Healthcare"

The trial included 489 patients who were not currently getting treatment for opioid dependence, but wanted a medication to help with the problem. Patients were given an induction phase of Suboxone, a sublingual film containing naloxone and buprenorphine. After the three-day run-up time, patients were randomized to either a low of high dose of RBP-6000 or placebo.

The monthly injection is meant to reduce opioid abuse by decreasing cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

""We believe that RBP-6000 can potentially transform the treatment of opioid dependence, if approved, by possibly reducing patients' treatment administration days from 365 a year to 12.

That reality dictated that uptake would be considerably slower than expected driven by insurers' conservatism and six-month review processes, as well as physicians' concerns about prescribing either Praluent or Repatha on top of a statin when other options might be just as effective.

When Praluent and Repatha finally made it onto formulary, there was heavy wrangling and discounting involved, with Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron giving major price concessions to payers in order to have a shot at gaining market share. Payers also used competition between the two PSCK9 products to procure additional discounts.

In short order, UnitedHealth opted to cover Praluent; CVS Health chose to cover Repatha and Express Scripts and Cigna said that they would cover both. In all cases, there were numerous criteria outlined, including pre-authorizations.

In the last year, the general contention among payers and physicians has been that many fewer patients than originally anticipated need PCSK9 inhibitors to control their cholesterol levels, especially considering the availability of generic Zetia and high-potency statins, along with lifestyle changes.

The JAMA analysis found that patient costs for PCSK9s were about $503,000 per year based on quality of life year gained per treated patient, while treatment with Zetia and add-on statins resulted in costs of about $413,000 annually  further damning the closely-watched drugs.

The major game-changer for these two drugs, of course, is the availability of cardiovascular outcomes data that could show the drugs provide protection against heart problems  unfortunately, that data isn't due out for another 12 to 18 months.

The REVERSE-AD analysis was an 'all-comer' study that included patients who needed to reverse Pradaxa treatment because of their need to undergo an emergency procedure. For example, in one case a patient required emergency surgery after sustaining injuries in a car accident, and in another a patient experienced an open fracture, which required surgery.

The program is a global, multi-center surveillance program that is available to all hospital pharmacies where Praxbind is being used. It is intended to collect anonymous data on dispensing and usage patterns of the reversal agent in a clinical practice setting, Sabine Luik, SVP of Medicine & Regulatory Affairs, at Boehringer, said in an email to BioPharma Dive.

Additional real-world data from the RE-VECTO Surveillance program will help fulfill Boehringer's post-marketing requirements by collecting data about Pradaxa from different settings and in different patients. The program will allow the company to assess whether both the drug and the reversal agent are being used the same way they were in clinical trials.

""Every emergency situation is unique. We believe that the data we collect will help us better understand how, and in which situations, Praxbind is being used in clinical practice. Ultimately, this information may help us provide healthcare practitioners and patients with relevant information about anticoagulation reversal when making treatment decisions.

While all of the new drugs have more favorable dosing and safety profiles, they have been struggling to gain market share. The high-priced alternatives are still not being used as often as the generically-available standard-of-care. Boehringer is hoping that having a reversal agent specifically designed for use with Pradaxa will help bolster sales.

"Innovation in Quality Metrics","The FDA is collaborating with industry to develop a groundbreaking new set of state-of-quality metrics","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/innovation-in-quality-metrics/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 16:17:00 -0400","NA","Innovation in Quality MetricsIn the world of pharmaceutical production, it is universally understood that a robust pharmaceutical quality system provides key elements of assurance and oversight for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. It ensures that patients are provided with medications that are safe, effective, and reliably produced at a high level of quality. However, despite recent advances in the manufacturing sector, quality issues remain a frequent occurrence, and can result in recalls, withdrawals, or harm to patients. Quality issues have also been linked to the rise in critical drug shortages. 

Regulatory agencies currently assesses the risk profile of manufacturing sites based primarily on their compliance history, as seen in warning letters and field reports, in conjunction with records on product recalls and market-based quality problems. These are not necessarily the most informative measures, and by their nature, provide historical or lagging data or signal detection. More relevant data relating to the state-of-quality, provided in advance, would better inform the risk factors that might predict quality problems and future drug shortages.

FDA s approach to quality oversight has evolved in recent years, and the new Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ) has made it a priority to establish a sounder basis for ensuring that pharmaceutical products meet high quality standards throughout the product lifecycle

This FDA led Research Project initiates a program aimed at developing and implementing a set of standardized manufacturing quality metrics. The establishment and collection of these metrics should provide various stakeholders   from industry to regulators   with greater insight into the state-of-quality at a given manufacturing facility, and allow stakeholders to better anticipate and address quality issues while simultaneously reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE QUALITY METRICS INITIATIVE

Since early 2013, FDA has been working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop goals and objectives for a metrics program. In response, several industry stakeholder groups have worked with FDA to develop consensus around the goals, as well as identify potential metric sets, including developing recommendations for their implementation and interpretation. Through a series of extensive engagements between industry and FDA there has been an acknowledgement of the complexity of the problem at hand, which is to develop a recommeded set of metrics which are objective and meaningful, easy to capture yet normalized to account for factors such as process differences and technical complexity. Furthermore, it is required that those elements selected will promote acceptable behaviors and not lead to any unintended consquences or unwanted behaviors.

Key Research Questions to Address in the Selection of a Proposed Metrics Set:

1. What is the appropriate set of metrics to collect for establishing the state-of-quality at a manufacturing facility?

2. Will this set of metrics provide adequate information for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturing, such as sterile injectables, bio-pharmaceuticals?

3. How should these metrics be defined?

4. What is the optimal reporting process and what support will be necessary to facilitate timely and uniform reporting.

5. What are the potential unintended consequences which may arise with chosen metrics?

a. Such as measuring OOS rate may result in companies not reporting OOS results or changing their standards of identifying OOS results to minimize the numbers.

b. Review of complaint trending might lead firms to resolve problems superficially without getting to root cause.

6. How can the FDA prevent manipulation of data and its unintended consequences?

7. How does company culture impact the data collection and the metrics?

8. How does the underlying quality culture of a manufacturing facility influence quality performance and how does one correlate its impact through these metrics?

9. How can one represent a set of complex behavior and performance criteria via a set of simple metrics?

10. How can these set of metrics be linked to operating efficiency and performance of the plants? Plants are naturally focused towards improving their profitability and cost. Significant efforts such as six sigma, lean, right-first-time programs are underway across the industry and have deep rooted support in many pharmaceutical operations around the world. Can the reportable quality metrics be a natural offshoot of such improvement programs?

ROLE OF QUALITY METRICS IN RISK-BASED SURVEILLANCE

Quality metrics are widely used throughout the pharmaceutical industry to monitor quality control systems and processes, and many of the components that inform those metrics (e.g., data on process capability output or statistical process control) are already collected and maintained as part of cGMP compliance. Several measures of performance are already common throughout the industry. The challenege is that they are currently defined differently across manufacturers, and even between sites operated by the same manufacturer.

The proposed FDA Quality Metrics program is not the first of its kind; rather, it draws from the example of existing private sector quality improvement programs that collect voluntarily reported, standardized quality metrics from a large and varying array of manufacturing sites, which are then used by participating manufacturers to benchmark their performance against industry standards and their peers.

The collection and analysis of standardized quality metrics can serve several functions:

  At a basic level, metrics should provide a quantitative and objective measure of quality at the manufacturing site, and provide a window at a systems level, to the effectiveness of the oversight and control of operations at a given site.","Biotechnology"

"Medical News Today: Slower blood aging may explain why Hispanics live longer","Hispanics live longer than other ethnicities despite having higher rates of disease. New research finds this may be because they have slower blood aging.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312374.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Seniors / Aging","Slower blood aging may explain why Hispanics live longerLead author Steve Horvath, a professor of human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA), and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Genome Biology.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Hispanic population in the United States has an average life expectancy of 81.6 years.

In comparison, non-Hispanic white Americans have an average life expectancy of 78.8 years, while black Americans and non-Hispanic black Americans have life expectancies of 75.3 and 74.9 years, respectively.

Interestingly, while Hispanic Americans have a longer lifespan than individuals of other ethnicities, they have higher rates of disease; for example, the rate of diagnosed diabetes among Hispanics is 12.8 percent, compared with 7.6 percent among non-Hispanic whites.

This has long baffled researchers, who often refer to the longer lifespan of Hispanics as the ""Hispanic paradox.""

Now, the study from Horvath and colleagues may help explain why higher disease rates do not appear to hinder Hispanics' longevity.

According to the team, no previous studies have estimated and compared molecular aging rates among different genders or racial/ethnic groups using epigenetic measures.

Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations to gene expression - through external or environmental factors - that do not involve changes to the underlying sequence of DNA.

For their study, the researchers analyzed the DNA in blood, saliva, and brain samples of almost 6,000 individuals from seven different ethnic groups. These included Hispanics, African-Americans, non-Hispanic whites, and Tsimane - an indigenous population of lowland Bolivia who are genetically related to Hispanics.

The team used a number of biomarkers when assessing participants' DNA, including an ""epigenetic clock"" - created by Horvath 3 years ago - that monitors epigenetic changes in the genome related to aging.

On analyzing the DNA in blood samples of participants, the researchers identified significant differences between ethnic groups.

Specifically, they found that cells in the blood of Hispanic and Tsimane populations aged more slowly than those of other ethnic groups.

The researchers believe epigenetics may explain why Hispanics have a longer lifespan, despite having higher rates of certain diseases.

Supporting their hypothesis, they point out that the biological age of postmenopausal Hispanic women - estimated using the epigenetic clock - was found to be around 2.4 years younger than that of postmenopausal women of the same chronological age.

Blood aging was slowest among the Tsimane population, the team reports; the age of their blood was around 2 years younger than Hispanics' blood and around 4 years younger than the blood of non-Hispanic whites.

""Despite frequent infections, the Tsimane people show very little evidence of the chronic diseases that commonly afflict modern society,"" notes study co-author Michael Gurven, a professor of anthropology at the University of California-Santa Barbara. ""Our findings provide an interesting molecular explanation for their robust health.""

While these findings may be good news for Hispanic and Tsimane populations, individuals of other ethnicities should not be disheartened; the team says the results could one day lead to a better understanding of ways to slow the aging process for all ethnic groups.

On assessing the results by gender, the researchers also found that the brain tissue of men ages faster than that of women. This, they say, may explain why women have a longer lifespan than men.

The team now plans to analyze other human tissues in order to establish their aging rate, and they also want to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms by which Hispanics have a slower aging rate.

"Medical News Today: Chronic pain more common in partners of depressed individuals","Chronic pain and depression are both common and mysterious conditions. New research looks at the mix of environmental and genetic factors behind them.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312372.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Depression","Chronic pain more common in partners of depressed individualsOften occurring together, chronic pain and major depressive disorder are prevalent conditions.

Both can cause significant distress and are known to complicate and worsen other physical diseases.

Globally, some estimate that 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic pain each year.

Despite these high numbers, the risk factors involved are still shrouded in mystery, although genetics and environmental factors are both known to play their part.

A recent study found that chronic pain has a heritability of 30 percent.

Other genetic studies, including a number of twin studies, have come to similar conclusions; genes are increasingly considered to be heavily involved in the development of chronic pain.

Depression, which is estimated to impact 15.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States each year, also has a genetic component. The influence of genes appears to be of the same order as chronic pain. For instance, one study estimated the heritability of major depressive disorder to be 37 percent.

Although a genetic component to both conditions seems clear, the way in which genes conspire to create chronic pain and depression is not understood. To further muddy the waters, environmental factors, such as lifestyle and sleep quality, are also known to play their part.

The exact interplay between genes and environment has always been a difficult problem to solve.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom set out to investigate genetic and environmental influences on depression and chronic pain. They used data from two large nationwide studies - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank projects.

Both projects were designed to understand the genetic factors behind health conditions. For the current study, more than 100,000 participants' data were examined.

Each of the individuals' genetic backgrounds were delved into, as were their experiences of depression and pain.

The team found that partners of people with depression were more likely to experience chronic pain, but a person's genetic make-up also played its part.

Overall, heritability was found to account for 38.4 percent of the variation in chronic pain risk; also, a shared environment with spouses or partners accounted for 18.7 percent of the variation in susceptibility to chronic pain.

Additionally, there were unidentified risk factors that were shared by partners or spouses. It became clear that the risk factors for chronic pain and depression had a significant overlap; the authors conclude that ""the cumulative effects of genetic risk factors for depression increased an individual's chance of having chronic pain.""

These findings, published this week in PLOS Medicine, might lead the way toward more effective treatments in the future. Chronic pain, in particular, is a common cause of disability, but very little is known about its causes.

The results of the study show that both genetic factors and chronic pain in a spouse or partner increase the risk of chronic pain for the individual. The authors also conclude that chronic pain is caused by an accumulation of a number of small genetic effects and is associated with some of the same environmental and genetic risk factors that increase the risk of depression.

In short, the two conditions are deeply entwined. Genes play a large part, as does the environment. The more we learn about the interaction, the easier it will be to find effective treatments for the conditions and, perhaps, understand how to prevent them from occurring.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Pregnancy: Antipsychotic use does not increase the risk of birth defects","Exposure to antipsychotic drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of congenital or cardiac malformations.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312370.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Mental Health","Pregnancy: Antipsychotic use does not increase the risk of birth defectsThe average number of drugs (over the counter or prescribed, excluding vitamins and minerals) used anytime during pregnancy increased from 2.5 in 1976-1978 to 4.2 in 2006-2008.

In 2008, nearly 94 percent of women took at least one medication during pregnancy; in the first trimester, 82.3 percent used at least one, and 27.6 percent reported taking four or more medications.

These statistics highlight the public health importance of research to inform pharmacotherapy for pregnant women.

Exposure to antipsychotics (APs) during pregnancy is increasingly common. APs are a range of medications that are used for some types of mental distress or disorder - such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorders - or used with antidepressants to treat depression.

There are two different groups of antipsychotics. The first type is titled ""typical"" - an older type of drug that first appeared in the mid-1950s. They block the action of dopamine, some more strongly than others.

""Atypical"" antipsychotics - newer medications that were approved in the 1990s - still block dopamine, but on a smaller scale. They also work on different chemical messengers in the brain such as serotonin.

The new atypical drugs have a decreased risk of affecting fertility when compared with their older typical counterparts. When combined with the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients, these factors are attributed to doubling the use of APs during pregnancy in the past decade.

Clinicians understand very little regarding the safety of APs on the developing fetus, and concerns have been raised about a potential association between APs and congenital malformations.

The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, examined the risk of congenital and cardiac malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to APs.

Krista F.G. Huybrechts, M.S., Ph.D., an associate epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and co-authors used a nationwide Medicaid database sample of 1,341,715 pregnant women enrolled from 3 months before their last menstrual period through at least 1 month after delivery.

Exposure to APs was defined as filling at least one prescription during the first trimester - the first 90 days - of pregnancy. Both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications were evaluated.

Individual drugs including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine fumarate, risperidone, and ziprasidone were assessed. Women were considered unexposed if they failed to fill an AP prescription during the 3 months before the start of pregnancy or during the first trimester.

According to the results, among the more than 1.3 million women, 9,258 women (0.69 percent) filled a prescription for an atypical AP, and 733 women (0.05 percent) filled a prescription for a typical AP during the first trimester. The most frequently used atypical APs in order of frequency were quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone.

Huybrechts and team found that 4.45 percent of births exposed to atypical APs and 3.82 percent of births exposed to typical APs were associated with congenital malformations, compared with 3.27 percent of births to women who did not fill a prescription for an AP. Similar findings were noted for cardiac malformations.

With the possible exception of risperidone, the authors observed no significant increased risk of birth defects for typical or atypical APs after accounting for co-existing mental and physical conditions and their associated behaviors.

The authors caution that the small increase in absolute risk and relative risk for birth defects observed with risperidone should be interpreted with caution because no clear biological mechanism can readily explain this outcome, and the possibility of a chance finding cannot be ruled out.

""The findings for risperidone should be viewed as an initial safety signal that will require confirmation in other studies,"" the study concludes.

Katherine L. Wisner, M.D., of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, IL, and co-authors write in a related editorial: ""The authors found that associations between AP exposure and birth defects were attenuated after adjustment for confounding, which implies that these variables, rather than AP exposure, account for much of the effect on congenital malformations.""

""This landmark report, with the largest population of women exposed to APs published to date to our knowledge, demonstrates that exposure to APs (other than risperidone) does not significantly increase the risk for birth defects, which has been a major source of concern for women and prescribers,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: What is Hypovolemic Shock? Symptoms and Treatment","Learn all about hypovolemic shock, a severe loss of blood or fluid. This article looks at the causes, symptoms, and treatment of this medical emergency.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312348.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Emergency Medicine","What is Hypovolemic Shock? Symptoms and TreatmentHypovolemic shock is the medical term to indicate that a patient has a decreased amount of blood or blood plasma, resulting in further complications.

There is more to the condition than just a lack of blood from bleeding or drop in sodium levels in the body. In fact, hypovolemic shock occurs for a number of reasons.

As it is linked to blood loss, the cause of hypovolemic shock may be difficult to diagnose. It is even more difficult to prevent.

For an overview of hypovolemic shock, it is important to look at the stages of the condition as it appears.

A person with the earliest stage of hypovolemic shock will have lost up to 15 percent of their blood. This loss can be difficult to diagnose. Blood pressure and breathing will be generally normal.

The most noticeable symptom at this stage is that the skin will begin to look pale. The person may also be experiencing anxiety.

In the second stage, the blood loss increases to up to 30 percent. The patient may experience increased heart and breathing rates.

Their blood pressure may still be within normal range. The diastolic reading, or bottom number, of their blood pressure reading may be raised, however. The patient may begin sweating and feel more anxious and restless.

By stage 3, the person with hypovolemic shock will have had 30 to 40 percent blood loss. The top number or systolic reading of their blood pressure will be 100 or lower. They will have a significantly increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing.

The patient will begin to experience mental distress, including anxiety and agitation. Their skin will be pale and cold, and they will begin sweating.

A person with shock from blood loss at stage 4 will be in real danger. They will have experienced a loss of blood volume greater than 40 percent. They will have a weak pulse but rapid heart rate.

Breathing will be extremely difficult. Their blood pressure readings will be under 70 for the top number. They may be in and out of consciousness, sweaty, cool to the touch, and extremely pale.

The obvious cause of hypovolemic shock is blood loss, but that isn't all of it. The loss of blood can come from external or internal bleeding due to illness or injury. Most of the time, hypovolemic shock will be a complication of another condition.

It is also possible for blood levels to drop when the body loses other fluids. Burns, diarrhea, and vomiting can all be potential causes.

Medical professionals and first responders are trained to recognize the signs of blood loss. However, it is also helpful for people to be aware of the possibility for themselves and others so that they can get help as quickly as possible.

Since this type of shock occurs from either illness or injury, it is difficult to determine risk factors. Anyone is potentially at risk for developing this condition, though it is relatively rare.

Dehydration may be a contributing factor in some cases of hypovolemic shock. Continuing to drink water is very important, especially during illnesses where vomiting or diarrhea may occur.

While a person can't always control an injury or illnesses that may cause hypovolemic shock, they can try to prevent further complications by rehydrating.

The easiest way for a medical professional to diagnose hypovolemic shock is by observation. A physical exam will show whether or not the person has low blood pressure, increased heart and breathing rates, and a low body temperature.

There are some tests that can also help make this tricky diagnosis. A blood chemistry test can give some additional clues, along with a complete blood count, also called a CBC.

The following tests can also help determine the condition and underlying cause:

The treatment for the hypovolemic shock itself, which is typically caused by another condition, can be as tricky as diagnosing it. The most common treatments are:

The hospital or doctor will need to get the shock under control to treat the underlying illness or injury.

Hypovolemic shock is an emergency medical situation that is a symptom of an underlying cause. The outlook will have more to do with the long-term implications of that situation than the shock itself.

If the shock itself can be brought under control, the outlook of the injury or illness will be the main factor for the well-being of the person with the condition. Otherwise, the outlook can depend on:

As with many conditions, hypovolemic shock is of specific concern in older adults. Because age has an impact on the body's circulatory system, any stress caused by loss of blood and the other symptoms of the shock can lead to further damage.

Blood loss of this level can also contribute to heart failure or stroke.

Older patients need to have access to emergency care as soon as symptoms are noticed.

As hypovolemic shock is usually a symptom of another emergency situation, the most important thing is to seek treatment right away. It is also important to understand that treating the shock itself won't be preventive, but it can lead to further diagnoses and treatments that can be life-saving.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Obesity-related cancer risk increased by overweight duration","A longer duration of overweight and obesity in adulthood is associated with increased risk of several cancers, including breast and endometrial cancers.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312364.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Cancer / Oncology","Obesity-related cancer risk increased by overweight durationHigh body mass index (BMI) has become the leading risk factor of disease burden in high-income countries.

Worldwide, at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. An estimated 35.8 million (2.3 percent) of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability - are caused by overweight or obesity.

Recent studies have suggested that the risk of cancer related to obesity is accelerated by time. The aim of the new study was to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity duration on the risk of cancer.

The study was led by Melina Arnold, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), in Lyon, France - and Prof. Hoda Anton-Culver, of the University of California-Irvine.

The researchers used data from the United States Women's Health Initiative (WHI). They planned to identify dose-response relationships between duration of high BMI and the risk of developing several types of cancer.

The authors note that to date, most studies that have explored the relationship between excess weight and cancer risk have observed cross-sectional exposure information - such as height and weight measured at one point in time - on overweight and obesity.

Using multiple BMI measurements over time, the team examined data from a total of 73,913 postmenopausal women. Around two thirds of the included women were overweight or obese, and 6,301 obesity-related cancers were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 12.6 years.

Arnold and colleagues explored how the timing, duration, and intensity of overweight and obesity impacts on cancer risk, taking into account other factors related to obesity, such as physical activity, diet, smoking, hormone use, and history of diabetes.

Out of all included study participants, 40 percent were never overweight, and 60 percent were overweight for some time during their adult life, almost half of whom were also obese at some point.

The study found that being overweight for a longer duration as an adult significantly increased the incidence of all obesity-related cancers by 7 percent for every 10-year increase in overweight adulthood period. An increase in risk was also seen for postmenopausal breast cancer, by 5 percent, and endometrial cancer, by 17 percent.

After adjusting for the intensity of overweight - how overweight individuals were - these figures rose to 8 percent for postmenopausal breast cancer and 37 percent for endometrial cancer for every 10 years spent with BMI ten units above normal weight.

The findings highlight that the duration a woman spends overweight, and how overweight they are, play important roles in their risk of cancer, which emphasizes the importance of obesity prevention at all ages from early onset.

The authors write: ""We found that longer durations of overweight and obesity were significantly associated with an increased incidence of obesity-related cancers, postmenopausal breast cancer, and colon, endometrial, and kidney cancer.""

Arnold and team note that although the observational nature of the study prevents them reaching a conclusion about cause and effect, or making clinical recommendations, the findings suggest that reducing overweight duration in adulthood could reduce cancer risk.

""If this is true, healthcare teams should recognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: Alzheimer's-causing proteins could be reduced with a healthy diet, exercise","A healthy diet, a healthy BMI, and regular physical activity could reduce the buildup of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312367.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Alzheimer's / Dementia","Alzheimer's-causing proteins could be reduced with a healthy diet, exercisePublished in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, the study found people with mild memory problems who followed a Mediterranean diet, engaged in regular physical activity, or who had a normal body mass index (BMI) were less likely to experience a buildup of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain.

Accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau are hallmarks of Alzheimer's; beta-amyloid clumps together, forming plaques between nerve cells that impair signaling, while tau forms tangles that can damage nerve cells.

The research - led by Dr. David Merrill of the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) - comes only days after Medical News Today reported on another study hailing the benefits of a Mediterranean diet against Alzheimer's, providing further evidence that lifestyle factors play an important role in the disease.

However, Dr. Merrill and colleagues say their study is the first to show how such factors affect the buildup of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brains of individuals with mild memory complaints.

""The fact that we could detect this influence of lifestyle at a molecular level before the beginning of serious memory problems surprised us,"" says Dr. Merrill.

For their study, the team enrolled 44 adults aged 40-85. Of these, 24 had subjective memory impairment and 20 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but none of the participants had been diagnosed with dementia.

Subjective memory impairment is where an individual believes they are having problems with memory, while MCI is where memory problems are observed by the individual experiencing them and other people.

Participants self-reported their BMI, physical activity levels, and the extent to which they followed a Mediterranean diet.

Considered the ""heart-healthy"" diet, the Mediterranean diet is typically high in plant-based foods - such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains - and low in red meat. It also involves switching butter for healthy fats - such as olive oil - consuming fish and poultry at least twice weekly, and drinking red wine in moderation.

All study participants underwent a novel type of PET scan known as FDDNP-PET, which measures levels of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain.

The team found that subjects who had a healthy BMI, followed a Mediterranean diet, and who engaged in regular physical activity had lower levels of plaques and tangles in their brains than subjects who did not adhere to such lifestyle factors.

These results, say the authors, highlight the importance of a healthy lifestyle for a healthy brain in later life.

The immune system mistakes the substances found in gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. CD is not an allergy or intolerance to gluten.

Prevalence of CD is estimated at around 1 in 100 people worldwide and affects at least 3 million Americans. CD incidence is increasing globally, which suggests environmental factors may play a role in the cause of the disease.

The objective of the Swedish study was to explore the effects of season of birth on the risk of CD, and compare different areas and time periods to suggest environmental factors that may be associated with CD seasonality.

The research team accessed a long-term study of almost 2 million children up to the age of 15 who were born in Sweden between 1991-2009. A total of 6,569 of the children were diagnosed with CD from 47 pediatric departments across the country.

Fredinah Namatovu, senior research assistant at Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine Epidemiology and Global Health at Ume  University, and colleagues examined the association between CD diagnosis and season, region, and year of birth.

Results from the research, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, showed that the risk of CD diagnosis among children born in spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November) was 10 percent higher than children born in winter (December-February).

However, seasonal patterns differed by region. Children born in the south of Sweden, where there is intense sunlight in spring and summer, experienced the highest risk of CD, followed by central Sweden, with the lowest risk of CD seen among children born in the north of the country, where spring is colder, and the summer is shorter.

Children under the age of 2 years were more likely to develop CD if they were born in spring, and children 2-14.9 years had an increased risk of CD when born in summer and autumn compared with winter.

Birth year was analyzed in three groups to observe any differences in trends: 1991-1996 represented children born during the CD epidemic, 1997-2002 included children born immediately after the epidemic, and 2003-2009 births were after the CD epidemic had subsided.

Children born between 1991-1996 had an increased risk of CD if born during spring, those born in the 1997-2002 group had a higher risk of CD if born in summer and autumn. In the 2003-2009 group, CD risk was greater if born in the fall.

CD risk was higher in girls than boys, regardless of age across all seasons and birth years.

The authors say that while there have been several studies that look at the association between season of birth and CD in Sweden, this is the first Swedish study investigating CD risk while taking into account four seasons and geographical variations.

No firm conclusions can be drawn from the research regarding cause and effect, as the study is observational. Also, one of the limitations of the investigation is the lack of data on infections and vitamin D level, which could be potential influential factors in seasonality and, subsequently, CD risk.

Namatovu and team write: ""One hypothesis for increased CD risk and spring/summer birth is that, those infants are more likely to be weaned and introduced to gluten during autumn/winter, a time characterized by exposure to seasonal viral infections.""

While some studies suggest breast-feeding to be protective against CD through mechanisms such as regulating gut microbiota and, furthermore, its effect on the immune system, recent studies could not confirm breast-feeding's protective effect.

The researchers also suggest that development of CD could be triggered by viral infections that alter intestinal bacteria and increase the permeability of cells lining the gut.

Among Swedish physicians, it is well known that the yearly epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, and influenza start in southern Sweden and spread northward over a couple of months, which supports some of the associations observed, the authors add.

Another suggested mechanism for seasonal variation of CD risk is vitamin D deficiency due to differences in sunlight and UVB exposure. Low Vitamin D levels during childhood are a risk factor for immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes.

However, every child is recommended and offered government-funded vitamin D supplementation from 1 week to 2 years of age, to ensure adequate levels.

""A remaining possible link to sunlight and vitamin D is that pregnant women who give birth in spring have the lowest levels of vitamin D during late gestation when important programming and development of the fetal immune system takes place,"" they suggest.

""Whatever exposures are important in explaining seasonality, they have to work in a well-defined period, that is, during early life when the immune system is in an important developmental phase, otherwise there would be no seasonal pattern,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: Brain's empathy center identified","Empathy is a high level emotion that helps us navigate the complex social environment we live in. New research may have found its neural home.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312349.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Neurology / Neuroscience","Brain's empathy center identifiedHumans are complex animals living in a complex environment. Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, helping us navigate social challenges.

Sometimes we do things to benefit ourselves; other times, we decide to act in a way that benefits others.

Humans evolved to be social animals, and, in social groups, people who only look after themselves cannot thrive within the group. An individual needs to act in a way that allows them to survive, of course, but there also needs to be generosity.

Being generous involves an understanding of the other person's needs; this takes empathy - an ability to put one's self in another's shoes.

Showing empathy and acting upon it is an essential part of being human.

That being said, some individuals - those with psychopathy or other types of personality disorders - do not have this hardwired ability and desire to help others.

Recently, researchers from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom decided to add to the current understanding of so-called prosocial behaviors and investigate the neurological origin of empathy and generosity.

Dr. Patricia Lockwood published her work this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To study this human trait, the researchers scanned participants using an MRI machine while they carried out tasks. The specific tasks were based on well-used models that test how people learn to benefit themselves. Participants had to work out which symbols they needed to press to bring themselves the biggest reward.

As a twist to the classic experiment, the participants also had to learn which symbols were more likely to give someone else a reward.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the results showed that people learned to benefit themselves quicker than they learned to help others. Additionally, using the MRI scanner, the team pinpointed the region of the brain that was activated when carrying out actions that helped other people.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area of the brain known to be involved in the control of a number of automatic processes, such as the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. It is also thought to be important in higher level functions, including reward anticipation, impulse control, decision-making, and emotion.

When the participants were learning how to help others, a specific part of the ACC was activated called the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC); this region was the only area to light up on brain scans, and it was not triggered while learning actions which favored the individual.

This implies that the sgACC is particularly tuned to controlling and monitoring generosity.

Interestingly, the team also found that the sgACC was not equally active in each of the scanned brains. Those who self-reported higher levels of empathy had higher activation levels, whereas individuals who did not activate it so readily, rated themselves as less empathic.

Although previous studies have highlighted certain, overlapping areas of the brain involved in empathy and prosocial behavior, this study adds a new level of specificity.

These findings are interesting in their own right, but they also hold potential for future psychiatric interventions. Because certain mental disorders involve a loss or lack of empathy, knowing which regions of the brain are likely affected could help in the design of more targeted drugs further down the line.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHA","A scientific statement from the American Heart Association says physical activity does not counteract the health risks linked to sedentary behavior.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312356.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Sports Medicine / Fitness","Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHAIn recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies documenting the harms of sedentary behavior - defined as any waking activity that involves sitting or lying down, such as watching TV or working on the computer.

Research has repeatedly linked sedentary behavior with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and more.

A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine earlier this year estimated that prolonged sitting is responsible for 430,000 all-cause deaths over 54 countries, and a more recent study claimed that sedentary behavior is a leading risk factor for mortality, second only to smoking.

While some studies suggest that physical activity can offset the harms of the prolonged sitting, other research claims that is not the case.

The new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) - published in the journal Circulation - supports the latter, finding that no matter how much exercise one does, sitting too much is detrimental to health.

Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D., chair of the AHA statement and director of behavioral research at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and colleagues reached their findings after conducting a review of the current evidence on sedentary behavior.

Highlighting the fact that Americans spend too long sitting, the review revealed that younger adults in the United States are sedentary for around 6-8 hours a day, while adults aged 60 and older spend around 8.6-9.6 hours a day sedentary.

The authors explain that sedentary behaviors normally have an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less. Slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, while vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.

Based on current evidence, Young and colleagues found that spending too much time sitting may raise the risk of impaired insulin sensitivity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death.

What is more, the review revealed that these risks are not reduced by moderate to vigorous physical activity, suggesting that prolonged sitting is harmful to health, regardless of how much one exercises.

Young says that, at present, they are unable to pinpoint exactly how long is too long when it comes to sitting, but for now, their advice is to reduce the amount of time spent sedentary and increase the amount of time spent active.

""There's a lot of research that we need to do. This statement is important because it starts the ball rolling and suggests sedentary behavior may play an important role in heart health and more. But, it's too early to make conclusive recommendations other than to encourage Americans to 'sit less, move more.'""

In line with the AHA's physical activity guidelines, the authors recommend engaging in around 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; they note that exercising in smaller amounts each day is more beneficial than trying to fit in the same amount of exercise in fewer days.

The most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccination, while everyday preventative actions - such as covering coughs and sneezes and frequent hand-washing - can slow the spread of germs that cause flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a yearly flu vaccine by the end of October for everyone over the age of 6 months. Vaccinating against flu can reduce flu illnesses, prevent flu-related hospitalizations, and protect people both individually and communally from becoming infected, known as herd immunity.

Current estimates reveal that the percentage of people who received an influenza vaccination during the past 12 months include 49.9 percent of children aged 6 months to 17 years, 31.2 percent of adults 18-49 years, 45.5 percent of adults 50-64 years, and 70 percent of adults 65 years and over.

There are several types of available flu vaccine options, such as the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), which are both injected forms, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the ""nasal spray"" flu vaccine.

Recent observational studies have shown that the flu nasal spray is ineffective, which has led to the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommending that the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.

The results of that research showed that in the last flu season from 2015-2016, the nasal flu vaccine had no protective benefit for children ages 2-17. In comparison, the children that received the flu shot were 63 percent less likely to catch the flu than those people who were not vaccinated.

However, new research published in Annals of Internal Medicine found that immunizing children with the live attenuated influenza vaccine - the type found in the flu nasal spray - did not provide better direct or community protection against flu than the inactivated influenza vaccine, or standard flu shot. The protection was similar in both groups.

Previous studies conducted in young children suggest that the nasal spray vaccine provides better direct flu protection than the standard flu shot, which would also suggest better herd immunity. However, most comparative flu vaccine studies assess direct protection only and do not consider community protection.

Lead study author Dr. Mark Loeb, of McMaster University in Canada, and colleagues conducted the research in the Hutterite community - a colony where individuals live communally and are isolated from cities and towns. The team aimed to identify if vaccinating children and adolescents with the flu nasal spray would provide better direct and community protection than the standard flu shot.

Amongst 52 Hutterite colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, 1,186 children were assigned to receive the nasal spray vaccine and 3,425 to receive the standard flu shot.

The team found that the nasal spray vaccine offered similar direct protection to children and in creating herd immunity as the standard flu shot. Dr. Loeb notes that while the findings do not show the superiority of the nasal spray vaccine over the standard flu shot, what they do show is that both vaccines had a similar effect, which differs from the ACIP data.

The new recommendation against using the flu nasal spray is for the upcoming 2016-2017 flu season. However, the CDC review new data to maintain or change recommendations on a yearly basis.

"Medical News Today: Will you age well? It might depend on your parents' lifespan","Offspring of parents who have a long lifespan are less likely to develop diseases such as heart disease and cancer in older age, a new study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312328.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Seniors / Aging","Will you age well? It might depend on your parents' lifespanLead author Dr. Janice , of the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, and colleagues publish their results in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

According to the Administration on Aging, in 2014, there were 46.2 million people in the United States aged 65 and older. By 2060, this number is expected to more than double, to around 98 million.

With an aging population comes a greater prevalence of age-related diseases, unless more strategies are identified to reduce the likelihood of such conditions.

While lifestyle factors - such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking - are known risk factors for poor health in older age, the research from Dr. and colleagues has focused on how factors inherited from parents may impact healthy aging.

Earlier this year, the team published a study in the journal Aging that found that the offspring of parents who live longer are more likely to possess genes that protect against a number of health conditions, including high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), and type 1 diabetes.

The new study builds on those findings, establishing a link between parents' lifespan and disease incidence among offspring.

To reach their findings, the team analyzed the data of around 186,000 adults aged 55-73, following them for up to 8 years.

Participants self-reported the lifespan of their parents, and subjects' incidence of certain diseases - such as heart disease and cancer - and death from these diseases were monitored.

Compared with adults whose parents had a shorter lifespan, those whose parents lived longer were less likely to develop a number of cardiovascular-related conditions, including heart disease, heart failure, stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation - abnormal heart rhythm.

In detail, the team found that for every 10 years at least one parent lived after the age of 70, the risk of death from heart disease among offspring was reduced by 20 percent.

Furthermore, sons and daughters of parents who had a longer lifespan were also less likely to develop cancer; each longer-lived parent was associated with a 7 percent lower cancer risk for offspring.

These findings remained relevant after accounting for a number of potentially confounding factors, including smoking, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and obesity, the team reports.

""To our knowledge, this is the largest study to show that the longer your parents live, the more likely you are to remain healthy in your 60s and 70s. Asking about parents' longevity could help us predict our likelihood of aging well and developing conditions such as heart disease, in order to identify patients at higher or lower risk in time to treat them appropriately.""

Study co-author Prof. George Kuchel, of the Center on Aging at the University of Connecticut, notes that aging is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, and the team's findings highlight the important role our parents play in the development of such conditions.

""As we understand these parental factors better, we should be able to help more people to age well,"" he adds.

"Medical News Today: What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?","Learn all about BUN levels, how they are measured, and when a BUN test might be used. This article also looks at ways to keep BUN levels healthy.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312337.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Urology / Nephrology","What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?A BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen test, measures the level of urea nitrogen in the blood using a standard blood sample. Urea nitrogen is the natural byproduct of the breakdown of protein.

According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, BUN tests are mainly used to assess kidney health. However, altered BUN counts can be the result of almost any disease, drug, or condition that affects the kidneys or liver.

As such, the test may be requested as part of routine checkups. BUN tests are also included in common blood tests, such as metabolic panels.

Medical professionals use BUN tests for a number of reasons, mostly to check or monitor kidney and liver function.

As the waste product of protein digestion, the liver and kidneys influence blood urea nitrogen levels heavily.

Urea is released by the liver into the blood and sent to the kidneys to be removed in the urine. Nitrogen is found in urea and is also the compound responsible for helping clear excess nitrogen from the body. For this reason, ""urea"" and ""urea nitrogen"" are often used to mean the same thing.

A component of many other blood tests, BUN tests may be ordered for just about anyone at any time. They require only a blood sample. A BUN test may also be done alongside other kidney tests, such as the creatine test.

BUN tests are usually ordered in cases of suspected kidney or liver disease. Though common in adults, signs of these diseases are easily overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10 percent of adults in the United States have long-term kidney disease. Many people are unaware that they have the condition.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explain that a range of medications can impact BUN levels, or how the kidney and liver work. Over-the-counter painkillers, in particular NSAIDS or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can all affect the kidneys. This class of drugs includes ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.

Natural diuretics, such as caffeine, and steroid use can also affect the kidneys. Antibiotics can also impact BUN levels.

There are many prescription drugs that can affect the kidneys, resulting in abnormal BUN levels, including:

According to the National Kidney Foundation, dietary supplements can also have a negative effect on the kidneys and alter BUN levels.

Generally, natural health products are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the effective dosage, source, and even the precise mixture of the supplement is questionable.

This lack of regulation also means herbal supplements may contain kidney-damaging compounds like heavy metals or chemicals like aristolochic acid.

People with kidney or liver disease are normally advised to avoid natural supplement. They are also advised to limit or monitor phosphorous and potassium intake.

Preparing for a BUN test is relatively simple. Those undergoing the test are advised to eat and drink as normal before the test. This helps ensure that results are more of a reflection of long-term levels.

Bringing a list of current medications and supplements on the day of the test can be helpful.

To perform the BUN test, a medical professional will draw blood from a vein. They will often use a vein on the inside of the elbow or outside of the hand. Technicians will then examine the blood sample.

After the sample has been drawn and the proper waiting period has passed, most people immediately return to their usual routine. The results will be sent to the requesting physician.

If the puncture site becomes painful, inflamed, or weeps pus or blood, the patient should seek medical attention. After the test, some patients may also feel faint, hungry, or dehydrated.

A rise or fall in blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate a wide range of health problems. This is because the kidneys and liver are involved in a wide range of body functions.

According to the Medical Council of Canada, normal blood urea nitrogen levels range between 7 and 22 milligrams per deciliter. A result higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter is likely to signal an underlying health problem.

Changes in BUN levels also occur with age and gender, among individuals, and during pregnancy.

Typically, BUN levels increase with age. BUN counts in toddlers are just 66 percent of those in an average healthy adult, and rates in those over 60 are just higher than in young adults.

BUN tests can also help determine the effectiveness of kidney treatments like dialysis.

BUN tests alone are not enough to diagnose any condition.

If BUN results come back as abnormal, medical professionals will usually follow up with other tests. A creatinine test and renal panel can help indicate kidney and liver health. Testing may be done to determine specific substance levels as well, like potassium, sodium, and calcium. Urine tests may also be ordered.

In some instances, physicians may also follow up abnormal BUN results by requesting tests to evaluate the blood creatinine to BUN ratio. The ratio of BUN to creatinine is usually between 10:1 and 20:1.

The course of treatment for each person with abnormal BUN levels varies depending on the cause and severity of the case. Those with organ failure often need intensive treatment, and dialysis may be necessary. Lesser BUN problems may simply require long-term monitoring.

In the case of abnormal BUN levels brought about by eating too much protein, people can limit eating food rich in protein, like meat, fish, beans, and dairy, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Staying hydrated also helps prevent the buildup of BUN.

BUN levels have also been tied to high blood pressure and conditions that cause restricted blood flow such as diabetes. As stress can greatly impact blood pressure, exercising, seeking counseling, and reducing stress levels may help steady BUN levels. Controlling blood sugar levels can also promote healthy BUN levels.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?","A study suggests that acetaminophen use, generally considered safe during pregnancy, may lead to a higher rate of behavioral issues in children.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312327.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Pregnancy / Obstetrics","Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?Acetaminophen - also known as paracetamol - features in a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, including actifed, panadol, and Tylenol. Prescription medicines that contain it include oxycodone and tramadol.

Apart from pain and fever, it is also included in treatments for allergy, cough, colds, flu, and sleep problems.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend a maximum dose of 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period, because overuse can lead to serious liver problems. However, as it is often combined with other ingredients, patients may not realize how much they are taking.

Previous research in animals has suggested that acetaminophen use during gestation can lead to neurodevelopmental problems, possibly due to a disruption in the endocrine function - the body system that regulates the hormones.

Studies of children in Denmark and New Zealand have revealed higher levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-type symptoms in those whose mothers used the drug during pregnancy. The FDA have expressed concerns about the use of acetaminophen and other OTC pain relief drugs during pregnancy.

Researchers led by Evie Stergiakouli, from Bristol University in the United Kingdom, studied data for 7,796 mothers who took part in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children from 1991-1992, along with their children and partners.

The team studied associations between behavioral problems in children and the use of acetaminophen by their mothers before and after giving birth. They also examined acetaminophen use by the women's partners.

They distributed questionnaires to assess the use of acetaminophen at weeks 18 and 32 of pregnancy, and when the children were 5 years old.

When the children were 7 years old, their mothers completed questionnaires about their behavior.

At 18 weeks of pregnancy, 4,415 mothers, or 53 percent, said they used acetaminophen. At 32 weeks, 3,381 mothers, or 42 percent, reported using it. The most common reasons for use were headaches, musculoskeletal problems, and infections during pregnancy.

After giving birth, 6,916 mothers, or 89 percent, and 3,454 partners, or 84 percent, used acetaminophen.

Behavioral problems were reported in 5 percent of children.

The findings indicate that children born to women who used of acetaminophen at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have behavioral problems and to be hyperactive. Those whose mothers used acetaminophen at 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have emotional and other challenges.

The use of acetaminophen by mothers and partners after the child was born was not linked with any behavioral problems, and the team did not find a link between maternal ADHD and the behavioral problems of the children in the study.

This, say the authors, suggests that the behavioral issues are not due to other, unmeasured social or behavior factors related to acetaminophen use.

A limitation of the study is that it does not reveal how much acetaminophen was used or for how long, but the authors believe that there is a link, and that something happens in the womb to cause this reaction. They call for more studies to confirm the results, to find out exactly what happens, or to see if there is another reason.

They also warn, however, that ""the risk of not treating fever or pain during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against any potential harm of acetaminophen to the offspring.""

"Medical News Today: Gout flare-ups could be managed by blood pressure diet","Gout is both painful and common, yet the mechanisms behind it are not known. A new analysis of old data shows that easy dietary changes may keep it at bay.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312314.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Gout","Gout flare-ups could be managed by blood pressure dietGout is a rheumatic condition caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints, known as hyperuricemia.

It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. Gout normally strikes in the base joint of the big toe and can be debilitatingly painful.

Flare-ups can last for days or even weeks, causing an individual significant discomfort.

Although the exact mechanisms that lead to a gout event are not fully understood, some risk factors are known; these include alcohol intake, hypertension (high blood pressure), insulin resistance, and a diet rich in red meat and seafood.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007-2008, 3.9 percent of all American adults and 5.9 percent of men (6.1 million individuals) had gout.

They also report that overall incidence of gout has risen 1.2 percent over the previous 20 years.

Although the dietary factors mentioned above are known to play a role in elevating levels of uric acid in the blood, the exact causes remain a mystery. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MD, recently set out to investigate the influence of diet on gout in more detail.

Dr. Stephen P. Juraschek and his colleagues reopened data from a clinical trial carried out in 1997 called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). The landmark study demonstrated that the DASH diet - reduction in salt, an increase in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and less red meat, sweets, and saturated fats - significantly improved blood pressure and cholesterol.

In the DASH-Sodium experiment, more than 400 participants were given either a DASH diet or a typical American diet for 3 months. Each month, participants were given differing amounts of sodium - 1.2 grams (low), 2.3 grams (medium), or 3.4 grams (high). The higher figure equates to a standard American diet.

Before the trial began and after each month, the researchers analyzed the participants' blood for various chemical markers; these included uric acid.

Dr. Juraschek and his team recently reopened the data set and analyzed the effects of each of the salt interventions on uric acid concentration.

Overall, the DASH diet led to a uric acid decrease of 0.35 milligrams per deciliter. Although that is only a moderate decrease, the team found that the change was greater for individuals who had the highest levels of uric acid at baseline. Participants with a reading of 7 milligrams per deciliter at the start of the study showed a reduction of 1.3 milligrams per deciliter.

To put that figure into perspective, drugs designed to treat gout, such as allopurinol, generally lower uric acid levels by 2 milligrams per deciliter.

When the team examined the interaction between sodium levels and uric acid, the findings surprised them - they were the opposite to expectations. During the low salt phase of the DASH diet, uric acid levels were at their highest; during the medium and high sodium diets, levels were reduced.

These changes due to salt intake were small but significant.

The authors, however, do not recommend that people with gout start adding salt to their diet. ""More than 70 percent of people with gout have high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Juraschek. ""If one was to consume more sodium to improve uric acid, it could worsen blood pressure.""

The results of the analysis are published this week in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology. Although further studies will be necessary to confirm the findings, the researchers are optimistic. If the DASH diet can prevent or at least minimize gout flare-ups, it would be of substantial benefit for gout sufferers.

Gout currently costs the healthcare system of America around $7.7 billion. A dietary change that controls gout while simultaneously controlling hypertension and cholesterol levels could make a significant difference to millions of lives.

"Medical News Today: Swap a soda for water to reduce weight gain","Swapping an 8-ounce sugary drink for water reduces calorie intake, obesity prevalence, and benefits overall health, say Virginia Tech researchers.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312317.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","Swap a soda for water to reduce weight gainStudy co-author Kiyah J. Duffey, of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech, and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Nutrients.

Obesity is a growing health concern in the United States. Almost 35 percent of American adults are obese, meaning they are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is considered a key contributor to the obesity epidemic; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than half of the U.S. population drinks sugary beverages on any given day, with consumption highest among teenagers and young adults.

When you consider that a single 12-ounce can of cola contains more than 9 teaspoons of sugar and around 136 calories, it is not hard to see how sugary drinks can play havoc with health.

For their study, Duffey and colleagues set out to investigate how switching an 8-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage with an 8-ounce serving of water impacts calorie intake and overall health.

The researchers analyzed data from the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), which involved more than 19,000 American adults aged 19 and older.

Specifically, they looked at how swapping sugary drinks for water affected participants' calorie intake, Healthy Beverage Index (HBI) scores - a system developed by Virginia Tech researchers to assess how certain beverages affect health - and obesity prevalence.

The team found that adults who swapped a single 8-ounce sugary drink - including soda, energy drinks, and sugar-sweetened coffee - for an 8-ounce serving of water reduced their total percentage of calories from drinks from 17 percent to 11 percent.

""Even those who consumed more sugary drinks per day could still benefit from water replacement, dropping the amount of calories coming from beverages to less than 25 percent of their daily caloric intake,"" notes Duffey.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that no more than 10 percent of daily calories should come from added sugar; the team believes swapping a single sugary drink for water could bring us much closer to this target.

The team also found that swapping a sugary drink for water led to a 9-21 percent improvement in HBI scores; higher scores were associated with reduced cholesterol and blood pressure levels. In men, higher HBI scores were also linked to reduced risk of high blood pressure.

Furthermore, the researchers estimated that switching from sugary drinks to water could reduce the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. by 33.5-34.9 percent, while increasing the prevalence of healthy weight by 29.7 percent.

Overall, the authors say their findings provide further evidence that switching from sugar-sweetened drinks to water can reduce calorie intake, which may reduce rates of obesity and its related conditions.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: 9 Diabetes Superfoods and How to Prepare Them","Learn all about nine different superfoods for people with diabetes. This article looks at walnuts, Ezekiel bread, and chia seeds among others.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312313.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 06:00:00 PDT","Diabetes","9 Diabetes Superfoods and How to Prepare ThemDiabetes is a disease causes elevated blood sugar levels due to a lack of insulin, the body's inability to use insulin, or both.

Poorly managed diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels and nerve cells, which may lead to foot problems and a condition called neuropathy. High blood sugar levels can also cause damage to the eyes and kidneys, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

People with diabetes should first make sure that they have a regular eating routine. Having a source of fiber, slow-digesting carbohydrate, lean protein, and healthy fat with each meal helps to control blood sugar levels throughout the day.

People should limit quick-digesting carbohydrates like white bread and pasta. Instead, they should opt for slower-digesting carbohydrates with extra nutrients like vegetables, whole grains, beans, and berries. These cause a smaller spike in blood sugar.

Here are nine examples of foods that can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet for people with diabetes.

The combination of fiber, protein, and healthy fats in walnuts makes them a great alternative to simple carbohydrate snacks like chips or crackers.

The fatty acids in walnuts can increase good cholesterol while decreasing harmful cholesterol. This may reduce the risk of heart disease or heart attack. People with diabetes are at a greater risk for these conditions.

People whose diets include large amounts of nuts put on less weight than those that do not, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Weight loss can help to reduce blood sugars.

The avocado is the only fruit that is a good source of healthy fat. Avocados also provide about 20 different vitamins and minerals and are especially high in potassium, vitamins C, E, and K, lutein, and beta-carotene.

Eating foods that contain healthy fats may help increase fullness. Eating fat slows the digestion of carbohydrates, which helps to keep blood sugar levels more stable.

Avocado is high in fiber too, with half a fruit containing 6-7 grams. According to the Department of Internal Medicine and Nutritional Sciences Program of the University of Kentucky, high fiber intake is associated with a significantly lower risk for diabetes.

Eating high-fiber foods can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, improve weight loss, and make insulin more efficient.

Ezekiel bread and other sprouted grain breads are less processed than standard white and whole wheat bread. The grains in Ezekiel bread are soaked and sprouted, allowing for higher protein and nutrient content. Bread made from sprouted grains tends to contain more B vitamins, fiber, folate, and vitamin C than other breads.

Ezekiel bread is often found in the freezer section. Sprouted grain breads have a denser consistency and are best when toasted.

Pumpkin seeds are high in magnesium. The body needs magnesium for over 300 processes, including breaking down food for energy.

A lack of magnesium is linked to insulin resistance, a main cause of diabetes. For every 100-milligram-a-day increase in magnesium intake, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes falls by around 15 percent.

Two tablespoons of pumpkin seeds contain 74 milligrams of magnesium. This is around a quarter of the recommended daily amount.

One study found that fisetin, a substance contained in strawberries, prevented both kidney and brain complications in mice with diabetes.

Other human studies have suggested that a higher intake of berries lowers the risk of diabetes.

One cup of fresh strawberries contains 160 percent of an adult's daily needs for vitamin C at only 50 calories. Several studies have shown a link between lack of vitamin C and diabetes.

Chia seeds are rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, fiber, magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium.

High-fiber diets are linked with stable blood sugar levels and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Despite this, most adults are still not meeting their daily fiber needs.

Just 1 ounce of chia seeds provides 10 grams of fiber, almost half the daily recommendation for a woman over 50.

Anti-inflammatory diets and foods can help to treat and relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term diseases like diabetes. Plant-based foods that are high in antioxidants are at the top of the anti-inflammatory foods list.

Ginger has been shown to be high in antioxidants and healthy compounds that enhance its anti-inflammatory powers.

Studies on ginger and diabetes are limited. However, research has shown that ginger reduces fasting blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

Low potassium intake is linked with a higher risk of diabetes and diabetes complications.

Spinach is one of the best sources of dietary potassium, with 839 milligrams per cup when cooked. One cup of banana has about 539 milligrams of potassium.

Cinnamon has been shown in some studies to lower blood sugars in people with diabetes, though not all studies agree. Participants in one study who took a high dose of cinnamon reduced their average blood sugar levels from 8.9 percent to 8.0 percent. Participants who took a low dose of cinnamon reduced their average blood sugar levels from 8.9 to 8.2 percent. Participants who did not take cinnamon saw no change.","Pharmaceuticals"

The research forms a part of the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) project, which aims to gain a better understanding of how different forms of transport influence the physical activity and overall health of the general public.

Lack of exercise is considered a key contributor to poor health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), insufficient physical activity is one of the primary risk factors for death across the globe, raising the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

Despite these well-documented risks, 1 in 4 people worldwide fail to get enough exercise.

For their ongoing project, Dr. de Nazelle and colleagues surveyed 11,000 adults from seven cities across Europe, including Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Oerebro, Rome, Vienna, and Z rich.

Participants were asked about what mode of transport they use to get around their city and how long they spend traveling using their reported form of transport.

Additionally, respondents reported their weight and height, as well as how they felt about walking and cycling.

So far, results have revealed that respondents who reported using a car as their main mode of transport are an average of 4 kilograms - or 8.8 pounds - heavier than those who reported using a bike as their main form of transport.

While these are early findings, the team says they indicate that switching to more active modes of transport, such as walking or cycling, has significant health benefits by boosting physical activity.

""If people can integrate this into their daily lives, such as going to work or going shopping, then it means you don't have to make special time commitments and it's more affordable for everybody. Getting people to walk and bike as part of their daily transport modes is really an ideal solution to try to tackle this epidemic of physical inactivity.""

The researchers note that they are not yet able to confirm a causal association between mode of transport and weight, but they hope that with their ongoing PASTA project, firmer conclusions will be reached.

The team hopes to follow a total of 14,000 adults from the seven European cities, and they are still looking for volunteers. If you are interested in participating, visit the PASTA website.

"Medical News Today: Food commercials change children's eating priorities","Researchers find watching food commercials changes children's brain activity, influencing their food decisions by altering taste preferences.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312312.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Pediatrics / Children's Health","Food commercials change children's eating prioritiesThe food industry spends around $1.8 billion a year marketing products to children and adolescents. Children between the ages of 2-5 years are estimated to view more than 1,000 advertisements per year, and teenagers almost 2,000.

Food marketing is cited as a substantial environmental factor in food choices and overeating, and, as a result, obesity, and TV advertising and branding have been shown to affect both food familiarity and preference.

Previous research indicates that children who view advertisements are more likely to prefer branded foods than children not exposed to advertisements. Behavioral studies have reported an association between receptivity to food commercials and the amount of food consumed.

Other studies have observed that children who are overweight may be more responsive to food branding and, as a result, are at a greater risk of being influenced by marketing. Research has demonstrated a relationship between marketing junk foods and an increased risk of childhood obesity.

A previous study by lead study author Amanda S. Bruce, Ph.D., assistant professor of behavioral pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, documented individual differences in brain activation in response to food advertising cues, such as fast food brand logos.

When observing food brand logos, obese children demonstrate reduced neurofunctional reactivity in the prefrontal cortex - a cortical region known to be associated with self-control.

In the new study, Bruce, together with researchers from the University of Kansas Medical Center and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, aimed to examine children's food decision processes and brain activity during active food selections.

Specifically, the team wanted to find out if food choices and brain activity were altered after viewing food commercials.

The research, published in The Journal of Pediatrics, centered on 23 children between the ages of 8-14 years. The children provided taste and health ratings for 60 food items based on how tasty and healthy they thought they were.

Bruce and colleagues studied the children's brain activity - with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - while making food choices after watching food and non-food TV commercials.

""For brain analyses, our primary focus was on the brain region most active during reward valuation, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,"" says Bruce. During the brain scan, the children were asked whether they wanted to eat the food items shown to them immediately after the commercials.

Results highlighted that, overall, children's decisions on the foods they wanted to eat were driven by tastiness rather than healthfulness. The taste of foods was even more of a factor after watching food commercials - that is, children favored specific foods and placed an even greater emphasis on taste attributes of these foods.

The researchers found that watching food commercials changed the way children assess the importance of taste when making food choices. The authors write: ""It is possible that the food commercials prime children to focus on the more hedonic aspects of food.""

""Food commercials may prompt children to consider their liking and wanting of specific food items, irrespective of the lack of any health benefits. This increased emphasis on taste may make it even more difficult for relevant caregivers to encourage healthy food choices. This evidence has implications for policies related to food advertising to children,"" they add.

When compared with non-food commercials, the vmPFC area of the brain that is associated with reward and value assessment showed increased activity at the time of food choice after watching food commercials. This activity indicates that food commercials stimulate children's brains in a way that non-food commercials do not.

Also, the more hunger the child reported, the greater the vmPFC activity, suggesting that when children are hungry, the effect of food commercials on brain activity may be particularly noticeable.

Obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents over the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The percentage of American children aged 6-11 years who were obese increased from 7-18 percent between 1980-2012, and similarly in adolescents of 12-19 years, increasing from 5-21 percent in the same period. The exploitative nature of food advertising directed at children prompts concern about the potentially harmful effects food commercials may have on children's health.

According to the American Heart Association, although many countries across the world tightly control or ban food advertising and marketing aimed at youth, this is not the case in the U.S.

Children and teenagers spend more than $180 billion each year, and they influence their parents' spending for another $200 billion per year. The American Heart Association notes that 84 percent of foods advertised as healthy do not meet basic nutritional standards, and 86 percent of food advertisements viewed by children are for products high in fat, sugar, or sodium.

The study results show that watching food commercials may change the way children value taste, increasing the potential for children to make faster, more impulsive food choices.

Future studies by Bruce and co-workers may focus on brain activity differences between lean and overweight or obese children when making food decisions after watching commercials, and the distinction between healthy and unhealthy food choices.

"Medical News Today: Blood vessel-forming protein could offer alternative to heart bypass surgery","Using mouse models, researchers shed light on how a protein called AGGF1 forms new blood vessels, which could help treat heart disease and heart attack.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312280.php","Sun, 14 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Heart Disease","Blood vessel-forming protein could offer alternative to heart bypass surgeryCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, responsible for more than 370,000 deaths in the country every year.

The condition arises when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, partially or fully blocking the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. This blockage can cause heart attack, angina - severe chest pain - and, over time, heart failure.

While lifestyle changes - such as adopting a healthy diet and regular physical activity - are considered key to improving CAD, some patients may require heart bypass surgery, which can help restore blood flow to the heart.

But, as with all surgery, it has its risks. These include chest wound infection, bleeding, stroke, heart attack, and kidney or lung failure.

In the new study - published in the journal PLOS Biology - researchers reveal how a protein called AGGF1 triggered new blood vessel growth, effectively bypassing blocked blood vessels, to treat heart attack in mice. What is more, there was no surgery in sight.

The process by which new blood vessels grow is called angiogenesis, and it was already known that AGGF1 promotes this activity. Exactly how the protein does so, however, has been unclear.

Researchers speculate that uncovering the mechanisms by which AGGF1 triggers angiogenesis could lead to a new treatment for CAD, heart attack, and other ischemic diseases - a treatment termed ""therapeutic angiogenesis.""

For this latest study, the researchers - including Qing Kenneth Wang from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio - firstly looked at how AGGF1 affects human endothelial cells, which are cells that form new blood vessels.

Early in AGGF1 exposure, the team found that the endothelial cells demonstrated autophagy - a naturally occurring process by which the body eliminates unwanted debris, such as toxins or damaged cell components.

By assessing the hearts of mice that had been treated with AGGF1, they found that endothelial cells and other types of heart cells responded to the protein with autophagy.

On applying autophagy-inhibiting drugs to human endothelial cells exposed to AGGF1, they were able to block angiogenesis. This, the team says, suggests AGGF1 needs autophagy in order to promote new blood vessel growth.

To further confirm their theory, the team genetically modified mice to have mutations in one or both copies of the AGGF1 gene.

The mice that had mutations in both copies died as embryos. While 60 percent of mice that had one working copy of the gene survived into adulthood, these mice showed lower levels of autophagy in their hearts.

In the next part of the study, the team studied a mouse model of myocardial infarction, or heart attack.

When heart attack occurs, this causes damage to heart tissue. The researchers found that alongside damaged heart tissue in the mouse models came an increase in AGGF1 levels, which they speculate is down to reduced oxygen in the damaged tissue.

Treating these mice with additional AGGF1 increased the number of rodents that were alive 2-4 weeks later, the team reports. What is more, the treatment improved heart structure and function, as determined by echocardiogram.

Compared with mouse models of heart attack that were not treated with AGGF1, mice that were treated with the protein showed increased autophagy and angiogenesis, increased heart cell survival, and less tissue scarring following heart attack.

Further investigation led to the identification of another molecule that is involved in AGGF1-induced angiogenesis, known as JNK; blocking this molecule with drugs stopped AGGF1 from forming new blood vessels.

Additionally, the researchers found that blocking autophagy through drugs or mutations in genes needed for the process stopped AGGF1 from promoting angiogenesis, and it also hindered the repair of heart tissue damage following heart attack.

This finding, the team says, provides further evidence that autophagy is needed in order for AGGF1 to trigger angiogenesis.

While the process by which autophagy induces angiogenesis remains unclear, the researchers say their findings shed light on how AGGF1 can be utilized to form new blood vessels, paving the way for non-surgical heart bypass:

"Medical News Today: HIV: Newly discovered component could lead to more effective drugs","Scientists have uncovered a feature that HIV uses to infect cells while avoiding  immune system detection. This finding could lead to improved treatments.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312291.php","Sun, 14 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","HIV / AIDS","HIV: Newly discovered component could lead to more effective drugsHIV weakens a person's immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. Only certain body fluids - blood, semen, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk - from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the United States. Although there is no cure for HIV infection, improved treatments allow people living with HIV to slow the virus' progression and stay relatively healthy for several years.

HIV is a part of a subtype of viruses called retroviruses, which means that the virus is composed of RNA - instead of normal DNA - and has the unique property of transcribing RNA into DNA after entering a cell.

This retroviral DNA can then integrate into the DNA of the host cell and remain undetected by the immune system. The infected cell can produce virus cells with different RNA genomes, which restarts the infection cycle. This unusual method of infection and replication has made it difficult to develop a vaccine for HIV.

Previously, it was unknown exactly how the virus gets the genetic building blocks it needs to synthesize the DNA to infect the host cell. However, the research team has made new discoveries into this mechanism.

A protein shell known as the capsid surrounds the virus. The researchers found that the capsid contains iris-like pores that open and close like an eye.

The pores can open and close very quickly, enabling them to ""suck in"" the genetic building blocks called nucleotides that the virus needs to build the DNA to infect the cell, while keeping out any unwanted molecules. This helps to explain why HIV is so successful at evading the immune system.

The discovery, published in the journal Nature, was made by examining the atomic structure of the capsid and creating mutant HIV viruses, which allowed the team to see the behavior of the pores.

Dr. Leo James, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology, says: ""We used to think that the capsid came apart as soon as the virus entered a cell but now realize that the capsid protects the virus from our innate immune system. The channels we've discovered explain how the fuel for replication gets into the capsid to allow the viral genome to be made.""

To prevent the virus from copying itself and infecting more cells, the scientists developed an inhibitor molecule - hexacarboxybenzene - that can block the capsid pores. The molecule successfully blocks the pores, ensuring that the virus can no longer replicate itself, rendering it noninfectious.

The hexacarboxybenzene molecule is unable to enter human cells, and, therefore, cannot help with any cells that have already been infected with HIV.

However, the researchers indicate the findings could lead to both future drugs that can enter human cells and block the pores from within and greater effectiveness of existing treatments, by altering them to penetrate pores.

Additionally, this new prototype molecule could assist in the development of drugs to treat other retroviruses.

""This collaborative work between Leo James's laboratory at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, and Greg Towers at University College London really illustrates the value of taking an interdisciplinary approach to discovery research,"" says Dr. Tim Cullingford, programme manager for chemical biology at the MRC.

""The combination of atomic-level structural work with virology has enabled them to make a finding that will shape the direction of future work in this area,"" he concludes.

"Cataract operations being rationed, warns RNIB","The Royal National Institute for the Blind claims that its research continues to show cataract operations are being restricted due to financial pressures on the NHS.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/cataract_operations_being_rationed,_warns_rnib_1100582","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 11:38:54 +0100","NA","The Royal National Institute for the Blind claims that its research continues to show cataract operations are being restricted due to financial pressures on the NHS.

In response to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's comments last week that any patient needing cataract surgery should get it ""without delay"", the charity says ""this just isn't happening"", and that some are being forced ""to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life"".

In a letter to the Health Secretary, it stressed that cataract surgery is still being rationed for financial reasons, despite it being approved by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The recent case where St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) recently announced but then retracted its statement that it would temporarily suspend routine operations in a bid to save cash is ""just one example of decisions being made as a result of cost-cutting rather than clinically-led"".

""Whilst St Helens CCG has now dropped these plans, they are still exploring ways to save money and we're concerned this could include cataract surgery,"" the charity noted, adding: ""no decision about me without me"" principle means that patients should have the opportunity to discuss the merits and risks of surgery with a professional. However, this is being significantly undermined as a result of CCGs' arbitrary policies"".

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) has also expressed concerns about potential rationing and postponement of second eye cataract surgery which, it stressed, should also be performed based entirely clinical need.

""The [College] understands the financial pressures the NHS faces but we believe that any restriction, postponement or delay in cataract surgery made through commissioning decisions will not produce the efficiencies or cost savings expected,"" said its president Professor Carrie MacEwen.

The RCOphth anticipates an increase of around 50 percent in the number of cataract operations needed over the next 20 years due to an ageing population, but insists that cataract surgery ""is a highly cost effective and efficient surgery that has a rapid effect in restoring a patient's vision and preserving their ability to live an independent life"".

The RNIB has asked for the Health Secretary's support in calling on commissioning groups to ""urgently implement"" NICE-accredited cataract commissioning guidance to secure the best and most appropriate care for patients.","Healthcare"

The total number over-shooting the legal 18-week target in 2015 was 92,739, compared to 51,388 patients 2014. Excluding the figures for bariatric and gender operations (which weren't collected last year), this represents an increase of 79.5 percent, it says.

Also, 77 percent of trusts are failing to notify patients of their rights under the NHS Constitution when the 18 week limit has been missed, the report notes.

The research - taken from 78 percent of 112 trusts responding to freedom of information requests - also found that average waiting times for five procedures (hip replacement, knee replacement, hernia, adenoid and tonsillectomies) exceed 100 days, representing the highest average waiting time in the six years data has been collected.

Also of note, trusts cancelled an average of 753 patient surgeries 'on the day' last year, the most common reasons for which were equipment shortages and/or lack of beds, it said.

The report concludes that ""too many patients are waiting too long for surgical procedures,"" stressing that, ""behind waiting time statistics there are patients who are forced to put their life on hold, suffering psychological distress, pain and having to suffer the financial burden of in many cases not being able to work"".

However, an NHS England spokesperson said there are ""major issues"" with the report that it has significant concerns.

It argues that the claim that 'the number of people waiting over 18 weeks for elective surgery is up by almost 80 percent' is ""statistically flawed, in that it appears to have been calculated by directly comparing results from the 2014 and 2015 surveys (despite acknowledgement that there was a higher response rate in 2015)"".

""We have significant concerns about this report which is both misleading and statistically flawed and is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the RTT performance standard,"" NHS England said in a statement.

""Waits for an NHS operation remain close to an all-time low - down from a maximum wait of 18 months over a decade ago to 18 weeks now, with the average wait less than 10 weeks,"" it insists, adding that ""last month more than nine out of ten patients were waiting less than 18 weeks to start consultant-led treatment"".","Healthcare"

For one, the number of patients who have had their care reviewed in the last 12 months - critical to ensure that their needs and that of their carers are adequately addressed - ranges from 49.3 percent in Somerset to 85.8 percent in North East Lincolnshire.

Elsewhere, the number of emergency admissions varies wildly from 1,840 to 6,046 per 1,000 of the population, as does the mortality rate for those with recorded mention of dementia, from 441 to 1,617 per 1,000, while the number of patients with dementia who have a blood test recorded ranges across the country from 57.3 percent to 86.6 percent.

""The Atlas exposes varied care, with some areas reporting much higher numbers of emergency hospital admissions,"" noted the Alzheimer's Society. ""We must urgently explore why people with dementia's needs are escalating to this point and what can be done in the community to prevent crisis admissions among this vulnerable group"".

 

""As our Fix Dementia Care campaign unearthed, it's currently easier to find out about your hospital's finances than the quality of dementia care they provide,"" it added. ""To make hospital's more transparent and accountable, we are calling for them to publish an annual statement on dementia care - this would include the number of readmissions and length of stay.

The survey found that more than one in four general paediatric posts at senior trainee level are now vacant, and that 60 percent of tier 1* and 77 percent of tier 2** rotas, which are mainly made up of junior doctors, have not been able to attract the full complement of 10 full-time staff.

Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Clark, workforce officer at the Royal College, warned that the paediatric workforce is at breaking point and children's healthcare is increasingly being compromised.

""There is no escaping the fact that an increase in junior and consultant posts is urgently needed, coupled with a radical re-design of services,"" he said.

However, because it can take eight years to complete paediatric training and as long to implement service alterations, the RCPCH has made a number of immediate recommendations to help sustain services for children in the short-term, including a breakdown of barriers to multi-disciplinary working, an increase in children's nurses and immediate opportunities for GP colleagues to access child health training.

According to Dr Clark, continuing to deliver the service as it currently stands is not sustainable. ""I urge decision makers to increase trainee and consultant numbers, better map training places to demand, and plan emergency and non-emergency rotas well in advance"".

Back in May the government and NHS Employers reached a ""historic agreement"" with the trade union on a new contract for junior doctors after more than three years of negotiation and strike action. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 68 percent of BMA members voting.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt then confirmed that the government would push through the contract in its current form, despite widespread objection.

"NHS patients missing out on cancer drugs","Thousands of NHS patients in the UK are missing out on access to innovative treatments that are available to patients living in some other countries of comparable wealth, finds new research by charities Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nhs_patients_missing_out_on_cancer_drugs_1099505","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 11:31:13 +0100","NA","Thousands of NHS patients in the UK are missing out on access to innovative treatments that are available to patients living in some other countries of comparable wealth, finds new research by charities Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK.

According to their report, 'International Comparisons of Health Technology Assessment', a key reason for the UK's poor performance on access is the rigidity of the its appraisal systems, in that they lack the opportunity for negotiation on drug prices.

The report reviewed the drug systems and the availability of breast and prostate cancer treatments in England, Scotland and Wales compared to five similar countries: Germany, France, Australia, Canada and Sweden.

It shows for example that Roche's Kadcyla (trastuzumab-emtansine) - a drug that can offer women living with incurable secondary breast cancer an extra six months of life on average launched two and half years ago - is available in Germany, Canada and France, but can only be accessed by patients in England throughout the Cancer Drugs Fund and not at all in Scotland and Wales.

Looking at global health technology assessment bodies, the research also highlights that, in many cases, they play a key role in access but are only one part of a wider process, and notes the opportunity for assessment of peer systems to gauge whether any elements could be applied to improve access to cancer drugs for NHS patients.

The charities are now calling on the Secretary of State for Health to review the current role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as well as work on renegotiating the current arrangements for the Pharmaceutical Pricing Regulation Scheme (PPRS) in time for 2018, ""so that price negotiation can be brought into the system, enabling patients to access the best available treatments at prices that the NHS can afford"".

""This report demonstrates the need for serious reform of the way our health system assesses, and determines the availability of, the cancer drugs that patients rely upon,"" said Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now.

""Pharmaceutical companies must indeed start offering more responsible prices. But until our health bodies are empowered to negotiate the price of cancer drugs, patients in the UK will continue to miss out on new treatments being offered elsewhere"".

However, commenting on the report, Dr Paul Catchpole, Director Value and Access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said it is ""too simplistic"" to suggest that the problem is just down to an inability to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies.

""Companies engage in pricing negotiations with the NHS but without doubt there is room for more creative approaches. This is despite the UK already having some of the lowest prices for medicines among similar economies and a deal which has seen companies pay back over  1.3 billion pounds to the Government in the last 18 months to help keep NHS spending on medicines affordable"".

He went on to say that the concerns of the cancer charities ""are real"", and that ""the NICE evaluation program hasn't kept pace with innovation and relies too much on a basic cost effectiveness threshold for assessing value for money and which remains unchanged in over 15 years"".

""With cancer medicines now more effective than ever in extending life, we are seeing scenarios where some new medicines used in combination with established treatments would be rejected by NICE even if they were given away free due to the fact that patients are taking them for longer. The bottom line is that the system we have in the UK for assessing medicines needs to further evolve"".

""Only when we see a fundamental shift away from medicines being used as a cost containment exercise rather than part of a sustainable NHS will we begin to improve services for patients. If we want to improve survival rates for our patients we should be prepared to invest more, not less,"" he argues.","Healthcare"
"Charity finds high stress levels among primary care workers","Almost nine in ten (88 percent) primary care workers find their work life stressful, which is significantly higher than the wider UK workforce (56 percent), research undertaken by UK charity MIND has found.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/charity_finds_high_stress_levels_among_primary_care_workers_1097184","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 09:30:46 +0100","NA","Almost nine in ten (88 percent) primary care workers find their work life stressful, which is significantly higher than the wider UK workforce (56 percent), research undertaken by UK charity MIND has found.

The survey, involving more than 1,000 NHS workers in primary care, including GPs, practice nurses, practice managers and their colleagues, also revealed that work is considered the most stressful area of their lives, ahead of their finances, health, family life and relationships.

Two in five (43 percent) said workplace stress had either caused them to resign or think about resigning, while 21 percent reported having developed a mental health problem as a result and, in 8 percent of cases, even led to suicidal thoughts. Also of note, 17 percent said stress led to them taking medication for a mental health problem.

On the physical side, 83 percent said workplace stress affects their ability to sleep and more than (54 percent) impacts directly on their health, and caused one in six to call in sick to avoid work.

Compounding the problem, healthcare staff feel unable to share that they are experiencing high levels of stress at work; 31 percent thought that disclosing this would lead to them being perceived as less capable than their colleagues, while 22 percent said it might count against them when being considered for a promotion.

""These figures paint a worrying picture, suggesting that levels of stress among primary care staff are having a real impact on both their mental and physical wellbeing,"" said Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. ""We need to make sure that health care professionals are well and supported, so they can provide the best care for their patients"".

Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said the poll reinforces his organisation's own finding ""that GPs and their staff are under unsustainable pressure because they are having to work long, intense hours on dwindling resources against a backdrop of rocketing patient demand. As this Mind survey demonstrates, the inevitable side effect is rising levels of burnout and stress"".

""Many GPs are considering cutting their working hours and one in three told a recent BMA survey they were considering retiring in the next five years. This is not only distressing for the individuals involved, but will seriously limit the capacity of the NHS to deliver quality care to patients"".

""The current state of general practice is pushing GPs to their limit, and these results show it is having a serious impact on their physical and mental health. It goes without saying that a service that relies on sick and fatigued GPs is not good for patient safety,"" added Dr Maureen Baker, Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

But she also stressed that NHS England's GP Forward View ""is a lifeline for general practice, and the pledges - including  16m to support GPs suffering from burnout and stress - will go a long way to alleviating the current pressures facing GPs, and in turn improve patient care"".","Healthcare"
"Software Best Practises: Implementation &amp; Data Integration","""I don t believe that the serialisation topic will end once the deadline is met in Europe. It s really only the beginning. The use of the data will continue and in 10, 20 years from now people will be doing different things with the data than we ever imagined.

It s really only the beginning. The use of the data will continue and in 10, 20 years from now people will be doing different things with the data than we ever imagined.  Michael Kinsella of Servier

Industry stakeholders have insisted that it could be a costly mistake to view serialisation as a project which only concerns engineering matters. As serialisation data is unique to the pack it requires not only the deployment of new treatment but also expanded staff investment and stakeholder engagement. Therefore,  To characterize it as an engineering issue is therefore to grossly underestimate its consequences, which touch virtually every business function in pharmaceutical manufacturing. 2

The updating of hardware for packaging lines may on first appearances seem to be a usual project comprising of routine timescales and considerations. However, some cases in the market have conveyed that installing and commissioning integrated serialisation ready hardware ends up being considerably more complex than first assumed. 2 New equipment capabilities have to be met in response to data requirements  including multi-substrate inks for TIJ printers and printer abilities to perform to aggregation and verification.

Effective data management is imperative to achieve regulatory compliance with a serialisation programme. Non-standard data exchange and integration methods are seen as one of the biggest hurdles in serialisation compliance.4 These projects will also incur a surge in the amount of data shared between trading partners, with the volume of data units being determined by the length of the supply chain in question.

In light of the data responsibilities expected within serialisation projects, Pharma IQ consults with a selection of experts on software best practices - data integration and implementation.

Pharma firms should have a clear map of their current and their target architecture, due to the evolving ecosystem that operates in many pharma companies. Michael Kinsella, Program Director, Serialisation & Traceability at Servier notes that the pharma firm is currently rolling out a SAP implementation at their main sites simultaneously alongside other rationalisation projects concerning historical IT systems.

So, here, a clear roadmap is imperative to ensure Servier is synchronized with their master data requirements to fulfill the needs in a timely fashion.

In response to partnership interaction with CMOs, Michael Kinsella from Servier noted:  The CMO area is quite tricky and it s often left until the last step because there is a lot of hesitancy about specifying  responsibilities. Who s going to pay for the interfaces? You may even have equipment that needs to be put into the CMOs to perform some of the data exchanges, you may need scanners, you may need relabeling, you may need reprinting or re-aggregation capabilities in order to be able to send data back to a mother system and to maintain the integrity. So it s really quite complex.  He adds that assessing CMO interaction is often underestimated. CMOs usually wait for the client to explain their needs, as it is the pharma companies who hold the marketing authorizations that are under the obligation to ensure boxes leave the factories in a conforming manner.

Depending on the responsibility or the contract held between various partners or the pharmaceutical company, it is not always completely clear what kind of investments the CMOs need to make and the interfaces they are responsible for.

 I think the first steps are not the specification of the interface itself   but more mapping out the relationship and the responsibility the business needs. - Michael Kinsella

This will involve categorizing the partners the pharma firm has, the type of CMOs and their responsibilities and requirements. Different arrangements may occur according to the authorisation of a product or the delegation of responsibility in the production, packaging and distribution of a product. Michael notes that in some cases pharma firms may decide not to  integrate their systems into, or to interface with the CMO s systems or exchange data. They may simply connect to the national database to which the data is transmitted to. In other cases, there may be a business need to exchange data to facilitate certain business activities, especially where the product is still in the possession of the pharma firm.  If the product has left their possession or has been sold, the responsibilities for the data integrity or data exchanges change somewhat.

"The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia","Bumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve","http://www.pharma-iq.com/medical-devices-and-diagnostics/articles/the-impact-of-cognitive-computing-on-healthcare-in","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 09, 2016</span>","NA","The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesBumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes. To find out more, we speak with Dr James Miser, Chief Medical Information Officer at Bumrungrad International Hospital, who describes the implementation process so far and how the technology is likely to transform healthcare.

  To date, Watson for Oncology has compiled nearly 15 million pages of medical content, including more than 200 medical textbooks and 300 medical journals.

  Watson can assemble and assess patient information along with relevant medical information from its entire database in less than a minute.

  Watson provides medical professionals with instant access to information from leading research institutions from around the world.

  At Bumrungrad International Hospital, staff will be using Watson to make their data organization more efficient and ultimately the system will help them decide on the best course of treatment for patients.

How is cognitive computing changing the way medicine is being practised?

Dr James Miser:  Medicine is changing dramatically, in large part due to our genetic and molecular understanding of ourselves and the diseases that we can contract. In essence, we re getting more complicated to medically understand. This leads to greater quantities of patient information and the necessity for more organisation of said information, along with more disease and treatment information. 

 Within the next 5-10 years, this mass of accumulated patient, disease and treatment information is going to become dramatically more complex. In order to give patients the best treatment  options, all of that data needs to be available immediately. This represents an immense challenge for physicians all over the world. Fortunately, a cognitive computing solution is able to absorb thousands of medical journals, textbooks, papers and guidelines from leading institutions in order to piece together the most appropriate data and outline the best course of action for the patient. 

Why is this of particular importance in Southeast Asia?

Dr James Miser:  The challenges in Southeast Asia are magnified because of the uneven distribution of  healthcare throughout the region, for example, the differences between major medical centres and more rural areas. If we can address this balance with cloud based cognitive computing solutions then I think we can have more of an impact here than anywhere else. 

Dr James Miser:  It s a cloud-based system meaning that primary, secondary and tertiary care centres would all have access to it. So even if a primary care centre was unable to properly diagnose a patient or provide the suggested treatment (many cancers require molecular diagnosis with advanced technological processes), its staff would be able to accurately determine where the patient needs to be referred to, with a clear idea of what tests and potential treatments may be  necessary. 

What benefits does using Watson give your colleagues in the oncology department at present?

Dr James Miser:   We re just about to start actively using Watson, which means we re piloting it after numerous test cases. So to be honest, initially the results will be modest but over time it will become more and more important as it is used in connection with a wider variety of cancers and cancer patients, especially in complex cases where the cancer regresses and then reappears often.

 Currently, it will help doctors using the system become more efficient as it helps organise the data, combine the relevant healthcare literature, provide roadmaps and so on. All of these processes will quickly become standardised too, which will allow healthcare professionals to practise in a more efficient and timely manner. 

So it s accurate to say that the benefits delivered by Watson haven t been fully realised yet and are going to increase significantly as more healthcare professionals become used to utilising it?



Dr James Miser:   Certainly. It s also going to deliver increased benefits for patients too in terms of helping to design more effective treatment plans. By March we re hoping to be able to present more concrete data regarding this area. The key issue is ensuring the information is available across the entire healthcare network, so that each medical professional involved is properly informed and can subsequently keep the patient properly informed at every step. In this way,

everybody benefits: the hospitals and healthcare professionals benefit financially and get a boost to their reputation, but more importantly, the patients will benefit. Instead of feeling cut off from the care that they need, they can go to their local healthcare facility and receive a diagnosis and treatment plan supported by the entire hospital network s expertise based on effective dissemination of information. 

Can you give a ballpark estimate regarding how much of an impact the system will have on oncology department efficiency rates?

Dr James Miser:  Cancer diagnosis requires the completion and analysis of multiple tests which Watson can carry out for the doctor. It can gather all of the patient s data, organise it and ensure it is complete before consulting its databank of medical literature and then making a suggestion on what the best treatment might be, based on its findings. All of this can be done in perhaps less than a minute   it s more to do with the speed of the internet than anything else. Moreover, it doesn t give just the best treatment option, it also suggests the next best option, and the next, with more options available if necessary. In some cases this is more for the patient to decide, because what s best for one patient may not be best for another, like whether or not to receive chemotherapy, for example. Essentially, Watson puts all of those options, all of the relevant data, literature and several other information tools right at the doctor s fingertips. It s really going to help them make efficient, informed decisions in a much more timely manner. 

We ve been talking primarily about Watson s impact on oncology. What other applications and impacts do you see this technology having?

Dr James Miser:   I think that Watson has wider applications to health in general. It can be applied to all types of cancer but it also has applications to the treatment of any serious or chronic disease because it can keep medical professionals updated on the latest practices, treatments and therapies as they are developed 

Will the costs of implementing Watson keep it prohibitively expensive for other less well-funded medical institutions?

Dr James Miser:   Watson was certainly expensive to develop but like any technology the costs of implementing it will decrease over time. For example, initially it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to map the human genome but now it only costs around $1000. In the same way, once Watson is applied more broadly, I imagine that the costs will decrease dramatically. There s even a case to be made by governments that its implementation will eventually save money as it improves healthcare efficiency. Ultimately, Watson can and should be implemented outside of the wealthiest institutions, because they already have the expertise, so they have less of a need for Watson s capabilities. It s in more remote and less specialised healthcare facilities in regions like South-East Asia that Watson will have the greatest impact on improving the overall health of the population and I believe that IBM and the other developers of Watson have that vision for their creation. 

What advice would you give any other healthcare organisation that is looking to integrate Watson into their existing processes?

Dr James Miser:  It s essential that you are able to link Watson to your medical staff effectively. Creating the right user interface and the right IT platform takes time, care, diligence and ICT expertise in order to create a scenario where your employees have a seamless connection to the expertise provided by Watson. So it s vital that you create a team of both ICT technicians and healthcare professionals to design that integration effectively. It s also very important to ensure that the right training in the use of Watson is carried out, so that everyone is up to speed with what it can do and how best to utilise its information tools.

 Due to its cloud-based nature, Watson isn t a simple  straight out of the box  tool; it does need some time and thought to go into its implementation. However, it is a fantastically user-friendly system and can be effectively integrated with any healthcare ICT systems. ","Pharmaceuticals"

The most popular professional social media networking website is LinkedIn which was acquired by Microsoft in June 2016 and has greater than 100 million registered users. With such a large outreach, these and other less well-known social media communication and networking websites are being utilised with increasing frequency by commercial organisations to communicate with existing customers as well as to lure new ones. In the case of the pharmaceutical industry, social media is now actively used to convey information relating to education, marketing, connecting with patients/physicians and receiving feedback. The major pharmaceutical companies have links on their websites to multiple social media websites and the potential of these is vast and thus far is largely untapped. However, statistics such as the number of visitors to these social media websites is comparable to those of other large industries such as finance and oil.

Benefits and risks of social media for the pharmaceutical industry

Safeguarding of information that the pharmaceutical industry disseminates via social media is essential. Although pharmaceutical industry websites contain a wealth of useful information, there appears to be a general apprehension in their use to disseminate medically relevant information [3]. The benefits of social media for the pharmaceutical industry are significant, such as its high outreach with messages being broadcast to other market segments [4]. A public hearing on the promotion of FDA regulated medical products using the internet and social media tools was held in 2009 with the presentations for all stakeholders that attended made available and this is a valuable resource [5]. Subsequently, a social media guidance webinar was held in July 2014 with all material also being publically available [6]. This is especially relevant, as the FDA have issued warnings in some cases where the existence of potentially objectionable information has been identified on social media websites [7]. The pharmaceutical industry should tread carefully in this territory, especially with third party data being a potential liability. This is because an imbalanced view of a product s risks and bene ts with erroneous claims being posted by such third parties (largely consumers) may capture the attention of regulators [8].

New trends and likely future directions

Despite the above caveats, social media offers significant benefits that should not be underestimated. Recent trends indicate encouraging signs of change as the latest raft of guidelines provides more clarity detailing new FDA guidelines [9, 10]. There are limitations of social media and the somewhat unclear regulations have impeded the pharmaceutical industry from utilising this channel whole-heartedly. However, the recent spate of laws governing social media use has brought more clarity to its use and may potentially embolden the pharmaceutical industry.

Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity","http://www.pharma-iq.com/clinical/columns/investigator-networks-cultivated-through-risk","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 02, 2016</span>","NA","Investigator networks cultivated through risk-factor trials, drives data diversity in dementia research. | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesExtensive investigator networks, cultivated over the course of some of the world s largest clinical trials into the risk factors for dementia, present an exciting opportunity for the future of dementia trials. Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and even depression have been linked to an increase in the likelihood of an individual presenting with dementia at some point in their lives. Indeed, the causes of dementia are as varied and as personalized as the disease s impact and symptoms. With dementia being one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide the social, economic and psychological impact on the individual, their family, their carers and the broader community, remains of critical interest to research organisations, physicians and pharmaceutical companies alike. As such, access to large clinical populations that represent a diversity of backgrounds and risk factors, could provide a solid foundation for the next major development in large-scale dementia trials.

The ways in which dementia impacts on an individual can manifest in different ways, depending on a number of contributing factors, such as the person s personality and their lifestyle prior to becoming sick. It is widely accepted that the symptoms of dementia are broken into three stages. These stages include:

The early stage: where the symptoms are relatively nuanced. Due to the gradual decline that is experienced in this stage, there is rarely any clinical intervention, despite, perhaps, the recommended alleviation of risk factors.

The middle stage: the disease becomes more prominent and the symptoms begin to impact on the individual, their family and/or their carer.

The late stage: is characterised by the individual s total incapacitation and complete dependence on their carer.  The physical and mental symptoms are obvious and memory disturbance is serious.

The length of time that it takes a patient to move through the three stages, again, is individualized. It is difficult to speculate how any one individual will interact with their physician s intervention. Due to the inconsistent/diverse appearance of symptoms and the broad range of contributing risk factors that may influence how the disease presents, developing a broad clinical population from which to derive data is critical in determining the efficacy and safety of any compound thought to alleviate symptoms and prolong the patients decline.

The scientific leadership that George Clinical engage with have been responsible for some of the world s largest studies into the risk factors that impact dementia.

 What George Clinical and its parent company- The George Institute for Global Health have achieved through their multi-regional trials [has] already had a significant impact on dementia,  Associate Professor Maree Hackett, Director of The George Institute s Neurological and Mental Health Division said.  The George s formidable track record in conducting large-scale, multi-regional trials into salt reduction, blood pressure lowering and stroke management, for example, have no-doubt made a significant dent in the instances of dementia globally. 

Stroke and blood pressure are two major contributors to the development of dementia. The INTERACT trials, led by George Clinical scientific leader, Professor Craig Anderson, is the largest ever clinical trial into acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) ever conducted with 2839 patients participating from 144 hospitals around the world. The study measured the impact blood pressure lowering has on patients after acute brain haemorrhage. The intervention appeared to reduce disability and improve quality of life at 3 months. Similarly, the ENCHANTED trial conducted with over 3000 patients globally, again led by Professor Craig Anderson, analysed the effect of two doses of a clot dissolving agent in acute stroke and showed that by giving a low dose, the risk of brain haemorrhage, a known side effect of this widely used drug, was reduced. These global trials, conducted across a diverse range of patients, countries, backgrounds and cultures provide a solid foundation for similar sized, similarly complex, trials into dementia.

Likewise, George Clinical scientific leader - Professor Bruce Neal leads the ongoing China Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS), the largest study of its kind, conducted in 600 rural villages across five northern provinces in China and Tibet. The study recruited 35 high risk individuals from each village, making a total of 21,000 participants. The rationale being that lowering salt intake will lower blood pressure and the stroke risk in this population. This approach to salt reduction has been identified by the World Health Organization as amongst the most cost-effective strategies for vascular disease prevention. The size, scale and impact of the SSaSS trial is staggering. The wealth of clinical data on one of the major risk factors for dementia, across one of the most populous regions on earth, provides future researchers with unparalleled clinical access and data sources.

 When conducting a clinical trial on something as complex as dementia, access to a largely trial-naive population with diversity demographic characteristics is key,  Associate Professor Hackett said.  The best thing about conducting clinical trials in the Asia-Pacific is that a large and diverse population is available, whose participation can produce definitive trial results   it is inherent to the region! 

As the world s population ages, and more people succumb to the debilitating impact of dementia, the capacity for researchers to access a diversity of clinical populations will be vital to the integrity of clinical trial data and the long-term sustainability of any intervention. Access to clinical populations throughout the diverse Asia-Pacific region, particularly to populations who have been identified as at risk, would provide a more robust data set for addressing a disease such as dementia.","Pharmaceuticals"

 Much growth in the sector is being driven by expansion into developing markets, thus increasing demand for people with international experience. Taking the supply chain as an example, although track-and-trace initiatives should simplify and facilitate logistics in the long-term, in the short term there may be increasing competition for those with specialist knowledge of developing markets.

 Additionally, changes in the broader business model are driving a need for non-traditional skillsets and backgrounds, especially technology and the healthcare-provider/payor side. Pharma companies are digitising their internal processes and data, taking an increasing interest in electronic marketing as a more cost-effective alternative to large teams of sales-reps, and needing to obtain and make use data from patients and heathcare providers. One can see the reflection of this in the healthcare workstreams being pioneered by the tech giants, such as Apple, Google and IBM.

Please note that the order follows that of the Fortune 500 rank.

First once again emerging first in the pharma industry ranking, J&J saw many successes over the past year, including its award winning efforts with the supply of an Ebola vaccine through Sierra Leone and joining the combat against the Zika Virus. This year saw the opening of JLabs in Toronto, a new 40,000-square-foot life sciences incubator, providing entrepreneurs shared lab space and offices, modular lab suites and access to scientific, industry and capital funding experts as they work to build important and successful early-stage companies.

However, the pharma giant has encountered some complications, for example with a court case arising focusing on alleged side effects of Johnson s baby powder. Also, media reports have noted that there may be a major restructuring in the firm to obtain cost savings, with expected net positions being eliminated from their global medical devices segment standing at around 3000.

Climbing one place in its Fortune 500 rank, Pfizer is reported to be providing 130 new jobs to manufacturing sites in Dublin and Cork. In Q3 of 2015, Pfizer finalised its acquisition of Hospira, Inc - a provider of injectable drugs and biosimilars. Additionally, following the termination of the potential Allergan merger, Pfizer announced that it is considering conducing strategic split in some form.

3 Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada)

Earlier this year, Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada) was reported to have paid US$20 million for an oncology drug produced by a team of scientists at Harvard. This is said to have been the highest upfront cash payment Harvard has ever received from a pharma licensing deal. In regards to the firm s Ebola Zaire, V920 (rVSV G-ZEBOV-GP, live attenuated): the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the vaccine candidate Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status.

Also,  Merck KGaA owned Sigma-Aldrich is reported to add 100 new jobs to its St.Louis base.

Making considerable progress on its ranking last year, Gilead Sciences has seen a number of wins recently, with the European Commission Grants Marketing Authorization for Gilead s Epclusa   also the firm has a a HIV-1 infection treatment in its pipeline. The firm saw year-on-year growth in total product sales in Q1 of 2016. Gilead s product Sovaldi ranked 3rd  in the world s top global pharmaceuticals in IMS  ranking.

Humira, labelled as the world s best selling drug for the past couple of years, has faced reports of potential competition this year as the US FDA accepted for review Amgen s Biologics License Applicaiont for ABP 501- labeled as a biosimilar candidate for Humira. Abbvie has achieved a number of drug approvals from regulators and have recently announced its oncology clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to assess the combination of Abbvie s Rova-T and BMS  Opdivo as a treatment for  relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Amgen s Enbrel is estimated to come in 6th in the ranking of top global pharmaceutical products in 2020 by revenue, charted to have accumulated US$7 billion in revenue by 2020. A patent suit has been brought in regards to this product in Q1 of 2016.

In the final quarter of 2015,  Eli Lilly and Merck s extended their Immuno-oncology Collaboration  to evaluate the fusion of Lilly s ALIMTA and Merck s KEYTRUDA. The combination therapy is said to be in Phase III and is focused on first line nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer.

Earlier in 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb signed an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Padlock   biotechnology company focused on the treatment of destructive autoimmune diseases. The deal is set to further strengthen the firm s immunoscience pipeline. Also BMS completed acquisition of Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc.   The trade contains complete rights to Cardioxyl s leading asset   CXL- 1427   which is in phase 2 of clinical development positioned as treatment for acute decompensated heart failure.

Last year Biogen was reported to have reduced its global workforce by around 800 people, in line with its corporate restructuring to focus its R&D pipeline which features Alzheimer disease candidates. Last month, Biogen s investigational alzheimer s disease treatment Aducanumab was accepted into European Medicines Agency s PRIME Program.

Celgene saw the most dramatic rise in ratings out of the Pharma Top 10 companies for 2016 - rising by 65 places. This firm was charted as the second fastest growing pharma company within the fortune 500 in 2015. Its cancer treatment Revlimid is attributed to be the engine behind this surge.  Also, Celgene has made a range of partnerships with small biotech companies.

In providing insight for job seekers in the pharma industry looking for their next opportunity, Tom Macfarlane noted:  Many job-seekers are inclined to focus on the larger multinationals, which they percieve to offer greater security and a greater potential for advancement. However these multinationals are doing an increasing amount of their research by partnering or backing smaller companies, including start-ups, with a view to acquiring them and their assets in the fullness of time. It can therefore makes sense to evaluate a potential employer based on their pipeline, rather than just their size. ","Pharmaceuticals"

Phosphoinositides are critical cell-signal mediators present on the plasma membrane. The dynamic change of phosphoinositide concentrations on the membrane including clustering and declustering mediates signal transduction. The importance of phosphoinositides is scored by the fact that they participate in almost all cell-signaling events, and a defect in phosphoinositide metabolism is linked to multiple diseases including cancer, bipolar disorder, and type-2 diabetes. Optical sensors for visualizing phosphoinositide distribution can provide information on phosphoinositide dynamics. This exercise will ultimately afford a handle into understanding and manipulating cell-signaling processes. The major requirement in phosphoinositide sensor development is a selective, cell permeable probe that can quantify phosphoinositides. To address this requirement, we have developed short peptide-based ratiometric fluorescent sensors for imaging phosphoinositides. The sensors afford a selective response toward two crucial signaling phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), over other anionic membrane phospholipids and soluble inositol phosphates. Dissociation constant values indicate up to 4 times higher probe affinity toward PI(4,5)P2 when compared to PI4P. Significantly, the sensors are readily cell-permeable and enter cells within 15 min of incubation as indicated by multiphoton excitation confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the sensors light up signaling phosphoinositides present both on the cell membrane and on organelle membranes near the perinuclear space, opening avenues for quantifying and monitoring phosphoinositide signaling.

Assays for phosphoinositides phosphates (PIP) have been constructed using PIP binding domains in cell lysates or expressed in cells. This paper describes a cell penetrating reporter peptide, which can act as cellular sensor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Figure 1). The peptide is based the protein gelsolin which has 20aa sequence known to bind PIP with particular selectivity toward PI(4,5)P2. To engineer a fluorophore into this sequence, a cysteine residue was introduced at Val59, which is a region of the peptide that interacts with membranes. A 2-dimethylamino-6-acyl-naphthalene (DAN) fluorophore was then coupled to Cys59. The DAN fluorophore undergoes a 60 70 nm shift in emission spectra (a change from green to blue emission) upon binding to membranes. Therefore, a ratiometric assay could be constructed by measuring the fluorescence of the PIP bound versus the unbound peptide (F450/F520 values were measured). Furthermore, DAN can be excited using two-photon microscopes using 780 nm light, which enables imaging of biological samples without confounding absorbance or autofluorescence from the sample. The affinity of the PIP sensor peptide was found to be in the 4 6  M range for PI(4,5)P2. In vitro studies using small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were initially performed to confirm that the PIP sensor peptide responded to different concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 content in membranes. A shorter DAN-13aa sensor was found to be capable of measuring PI(4,5)P2 localization in HEK293 cells. Variation of this peptide could improve the selectivity of this probe and potentially expand to other PIP species.

No, they stay in the gene s corner, patching the gene s damage, keeping the gene in the transcriptional ring. Because the gene s molecular seconds can lessen knockout efficiency, those who would keep the gene down for the count might consider a two-step strategy. First, as always, groom the most formidable opponent, the most efficient CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide RNA (sgRNA) combination. Second, interfere with the cell s DNA repair mechanisms.

This two-step strategy occurred to scientists based at the University of California, Berkeley. They began by considering a long-standing puzzle: Why do some sgRNAs work well, setting up the Cas9 nuclease to cut and disable a gene nearly 100% of the time, while other sgRNAs bind to DNA but seldom or never knock out a gene?

The scientific director of UC Berkeley s Innovative Genomics Initiative, Jacob Corn, Ph.D., suspected that Cas9's occasionally poor cutting efficiency might be related to how DNA is repaired, since DNA repair mechanisms the enzymatic corner men that fix any breaks or deletions in the DNA that might lead to a deadly mutation differ from cell to cell. Dr. Corn reasoned that random strands of DNA none of them similar to any actual human DNA (that is, nonhomologous) might confuse the repair process and improve the knockout success rate.

""It gives the cell a little kick to prevent normal repair from happening,"" said Dr. Corn.

He portrays CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a competition between cutting and DNA repair: once Cas9 cuts, the cell exactly replaces the cut DNA, which Cas9 cuts again, in an endless cycle of cut and repair until the repair enzymes make a mistake and the gene ends up dysfunctional. Perhaps, he speculated, the oligonucleotides decrease the fidelity of the repair process, or make the cell switch to a more error-prone repair that allows Cas9 to  break the gene more readily.

Dr. Corn is the senior author of an article ( Non-homologous DNA Increases Gene Disruption Efficiency by Altering DNA Repair Outcomes ) that appeared August 17 in the journal Nature Communications. The article describes how the two-step gene knockout strategy increased knockout efficiency by as much as five times.

 Non-homologous single-stranded DNA greatly stimulates Cas9-mediated gene disruption in the absence of homology-directed repair,  wrote the article s authors.  This stimulation increases the frequency of clones with homozygous gene disruptions and rescues otherwise ineffective sgRNAs. 

The authors added that the molecular outcome of enhanced gene disruption depends upon cellular context,  stimulating deletion of genomic sequence or insertion of non-homologous DNA at the edited locus in a cell line specific manner.  Most important: ""Non-homologous DNA appears to divert cells towards error-prone instead of error-free repair pathways, dramatically increasing the frequency of gene disruption.""

""It turns out that if you do something really simple just feed cells inexpensive synthetic oligonucleotides that have no homology anywhere in the human genome the rates of editing go up as much as five times,"" asserted Dr. Corn. The technique boosts the efficiency of all CRISPR/Cas9s, even those that initially failed to work at all.

With higher efficiency, researchers will have better success at creating the knockouts they want, and then using those knockout cell lines to explore the function of a gene or a group of genes. Because most long-lived cell lines are derived from cancer cells including the very popular HeLa cell line these cell lines typically have more than the normal two copies of each gene. This can make it difficult to knock out all copies at once, and higher efficiency greatly increases the chance of success.

High efficiency also is essential when knocking out genes to correct hereditary mutations in humans. Physicians have speculated about knocking out genes that make people susceptible to infectious diseases, such as AIDS, or prone to autoimmune, inflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders. It remains to be seen whether the approach described by Dr. Corn and colleagues could be used in a therapeutic context, but it is very effective for research purposes.

Dr. Corn and colleagues also intend to take advantage of the peculiarities of DNA repair to improve sequence insertion, so that a defective gene can be replaced with a normal gene, and possibly cure a genetic disease.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Want to Survive Ebola? Perhaps Malaria Infection Can Help?"," 
	In 1927, Austrian physician Julius Wagner-Jauregg won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of dementia paralytica associated with neurosyphilis infection.

While close to 15% of patients died from the malaria infections, at the time this treatment course was deemed preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.

Now, a study led by scientists from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that people infected with Ebola virus were 20% more likely to survive if they were co-infected with malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites. Moreover, higher parasitemias (percentage of parasites in the blood) correlated with increased rates of Ebola survival. Though the scientists are not advocating deliberate infections with malaria as Dr. Wagner-Jauregg did, they are hopeful that their study will open up much need avenues of research in dealing with highly virulent microbial pathogens such as Ebola.

The findings from this study were published recently in Clinical Infectious Diseases in an article entitled  Plasmodium Parasitemia Associated With Increased Survival in Ebola Virus Infected Patients. 

At a joint diagnostic laboratory established in Liberia by the NIH and the CDC, the scientists tested 1868 blood samples taken from individuals seeking care for possible Ebola virus infection at the M decins Sans Fronti res ELWA3 Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia. Testing confirmed Ebola virus infection in 1182 samples, of which 956 were tested for Plasmodium parasites, resulting in 185 positives.

Amazingly, 58% with co-infections survived, compared to 46% who were infected with Ebola virus alone. Furthermore, those with the highest parasitemia levels showed an 83% survival rate.

Antimalarial drugs were routinely administered to all patients seen at the treatment unit during the Ebola outbreak. However, the investigators claimed that it had no bearing on the increased survival in Plasmodium-infected patients in the study. This evidence was supported by separate experiments conducted in the U.S., where treatment with antimalarials did not affect survival in laboratory mice infected with Ebola virus.

The research team is now in the process of pinpointing a mechanism that could explain the association between Plasmodium infection and surviving an Ebola infection with the hope of uncovering new treatment modalities.

 Plasmodium species parasitemia is associated with an increase in the probability of surviving Ebola virus infection,  the authors concluded.  More research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon and translate it into treatment options for Ebola virus infection. ","Pharmaceuticals"

In fact, phosphorylating a specific spot on the protein called S421 protected a mouse model of Huntington's from developing symptoms of the disease.

""I was shocked at the profound effect phosphorylation had on the Huntington's model mice,"" said first author Ian Kratter, M.D., Ph.D., a former graduate student at Gladstone and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). ""They showed few signs of the motor dysfunction, depression, or anxiety that are characteristic of the disease. In most of our tests, they were virtually indistinguishable from healthy mice.""

The mice were also protected against neuron death, particularly in the striatum, the movement and reward center of the brain that is first affected in Huntington's disease. The scientists think that phosphorylation enables neurons to remove more of the harmful protein so it does not accumulate and damage the cell.

""Phosphorylation helps control how proteins fold and the systems in cells that clear proteins,"" explained Dr. Finkbeiner, who is a senior investigator at Gladstone. ""This is exciting, because a lot of the work we've done points to these protein removal pathways as being important not only for Huntington's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding how phosphorylation links to these pathways could help treat several different brain diseases.""

The researchers are now exploring ways to mimic the effects of phosphorylation with a drug.

A particularly challenging biochemical symphony, one that included movements in both RNA synthesis and RNA replication, had been played through, possibly for the first time in four billion years.

According to a study that appeared August 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists based at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) created a ribozyme that succeeded in replicating short lengths of RNA efficiently, and in performing transcription on even longer RNAs to make functional RNA molecules with complex structures. This virtuoso performance comes close to what scientists imagine an  RNA World  RNA replicator would have been capable of doing to support life before modern biology, where protein enzymes now handle gene replication and transcription.

The study, which was led by TSRI s Gerald F. Joyce, Ph.D., and David P. Horning, Ph.D., culminated in the PNAS article, which was entitled,  Amplification of RNA by an RNA Polymerase Ribozyme.  The article describes how the TSRI scientists used test-tube evolution techniques to tackle the decades-old challenge of creating an enzyme that could both replicate and transcribe RNA and thus support an RNA world.

The team started with an enzyme that had been developed and improved upon by other researchers since the early 1990s. The class I RNA polymerase ribozyme, as it has come to be known, can perform the basic task of RNA synthesis required for transcribing an RNA template into a functional RNA molecule by binding to a strand of RNA and using it as a template to stitch together a complementary RNA strand.

The team reported that it developed an improved polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even transfer RNA (tRNA).

 The polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR,  wrote the authors of the PNAS article.  Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. 

Prior forms of the ribozyme had been very limited in the RNA sequences they could handle and couldn't transcribe RNAs that have even moderately complex structures. Because of those limitations, they also could not perform full replication of RNA, which requires the transcription of a complementary strand back into a copy of the original.

""We found that the new ribozyme can handle most sequences and all but the most difficult structures, so we can use it to make a variety of functional RNA molecules,"" said Dr. Joyce.

Even when synthesizing the limited RNA sequences that the original class I RNA polymerase ribozyme could handle, the improved ribozyme, called 24-3, proved capable of stitching them together about 100 times faster than its ancestor could.

Turning to the much harder task of replication, the TSRI researchers found that ribozyme 24-3 could copy RNAs of up to two dozen nucleotides, achieving what biologists call ""exponential replication"" and creating as many as 40,000 copies of a target RNA within 24 hours.

The 24-3 ribozyme is thus the first ever to combine the two basic capabilities RNA synthesis and RNA replication necessary for a pre-protein, pre-DNA world of RNA life.

To generate and sustain a true ""RNA world,"" the new ribozyme will have to be improved further to enable the replication of longer, more complex RNA molecules crucially including the polymerase ribozyme itself. The Joyce laboratory is now driving its ribozyme toward that goal with further test-tube evolution experiments.

""A polymerase ribozyme that achieves exponential amplification of itself will meet the criteria for being alive,"" Dr. Joyce concluded. ""That's a summit that's now within sight.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, visible light, as detected by the human eye, represents an array of colors of various wavelengths. The evidence is continuing to mount suggesting that particular wavelengths affect sleep and wakefulness states within the brain.

Now, investigators led by scientists at Oxford University have published results from a recent study that shows blue light wavelengths keep mice awake longer, whereas green light wavelengths put them to sleep more easily. The researchers are hopeful that this new information will not only provide new insight into sleep and sleep disorders but could also have potential implications in future lighting designs.

For mice, which are mostly nocturnal, light is a sleep-inducer. Previous studies in mice and humans have shown that nonimage-forming light perception occurs, in particular photosensitive cells in the eye and involves a light sensor called melanopsin. Mice without melanopsin (Opn4 / ) show a delay in their response to falling asleep when exposed to light, pointing to a critical role for melanopsin in sleep regulation.

The Oxford researchers wanted to investigate this phenomenon further by studying sleep induction in mice exposed to colored light, i.e., the light of different wavelengths. On the basis of the physical properties of melanopsin, which is most sensitive to blue light, the researchers hypothesized that blue light would be the most potent sleep inducer.

However, much to their amazement, the scientist found that green light puts mice to sleep quickly, whereas blue light seems to stimulate the mice, although they did fall asleep eventually. Mice lacking melanopsin were oblivious to light color, demonstrating that the protein is directing the differential response.

 We assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep,  the authors wrote.  Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4 / ), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. 

The findings from this study were published recently in PLOS Biology in the article ""Melanopsin Regulates Both Sleep-Promoting and Arousal-Promoting Responses to Light. 

Additionally, the researchers found that both green and blue light elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in the blood of exposed mice compared with mice kept in the dark. However, corticosterone levels in response to blue light were higher than levels in mice exposed to green light. Interestingly, when the researchers gave the mice drugs that blocked the effects of corticosterone, they were able to mitigate the effects of blue light drugged mice exposed to blue light went to sleep faster than control mice that had received placebos.

The Oxford team feel this work adds the growing body of data concerning the effect of colored lights  on humans. For instance, previous work has shown that exposure to blue light a predominant component of light emitted by computer and smartphone screens recapitulates arousal and wakefulness in humans, as it does in mice.

""Despite the differences between nocturnal and diurnal species, light may play a similar alerting role in mice as has been shown in humans,  the authors remarked. Overall, the authors say their work ""shows the extent to which light affects our physiology and has significant implications for the design and use of artificial light sources.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The study (""A Genome-Editing Strategy to Treat  -Hemoglobinopathies That Recapitulates a Mutation Associated with a Benign Genetic Condition""), which appears online in Nature Medicine, provides proof-of-principle for a new approach to treat common blood disorders by genome editing, according to the investigators.

 

 ""Our approach to gene editing is informed by the known benefits of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin,"" said Mitchell J. Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology and one of the study's lead authors. ""It has been known for some time that individuals with genetic mutations that persistently elevate fetal hemoglobin are resistant to the symptoms of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, genetic forms of severe anemia that are common in many regions of the world. We have found a way to use CRISPR gene editing to produce similar benefits.""

 

 Fetal and adult hemoglobin are two different molecular forms of the essential oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Hemoglobins are made up of different combinations of four molecular subunits. Sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia are caused by mutations in a gene encoding the adult-expressed  -subunit. Disease becomes apparent after birth as the levels of adult hemoglobin take hold and levels of fetal hemoglobin decline. These mutations can affect the survival of red blood cells and inhibit oxygen delivery to tissues, causing impaired function of different organs with devastating consequences for patients.

 

 Fetal hemoglobin lacks  -subunits and has  -subunits instead. Thus,  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease associated mutations, which impair the production or function of the  -subunit, do not cause problems with fetal hemoglobin, which can transport oxygen effectively in adults.

 

 Experts have known for some time that inhibiting or reversing "" -to- "" switching of hemoglobin subunits can raise levels of fetal hemoglobin in adults and significantly ameliorate the debilitating symptoms of  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease.

 

 ""Our work has identified a potential DNA target for genome editing mediated therapy and offers proof-of-principle for a possible approach to treat sickle cell and  -thalassemia,"" added Dr. Weiss. ""We have been able to snip that DNA target using CRISPR, remove a short segment in a control section of DNA that stimulates  -to-  switching, and join the ends back up to produce sustained elevation of fetal hemoglobin levels in adult red blood cells.""

 

 When the scientists edited the DNA of blood-forming stem cells derived from patients with sickle cell disease, they were able to activate those genes and produce red blood cells that had enough fetal hemoglobin to be healthy.

 

 Recently, scientists have used several gene-editing approaches to manipulate blood-forming stem cells for the possible treatment of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, including repair of specific disease-causing mutations and other strategies to inhibit  -to-  switching. All of these approaches remain untested in patients.

""Our results represent an additional approach to these existing innovative strategies and compare favorably in terms of the levels of fetal hemoglobin that are produced by our experimental system,"" said Dr. Weiss. Using genome editing to restore the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is an attractive possibility, because it can be achieved relatively easily using current technologies. The condition is known to be benign in people who inherit similar naturally occurring mutations.

 

 The researchers want to refine the gene-editing process further and perform other experiments to minimize potentially harmful off-target mutations before in-human clinical trials are considered.

The young researcher, Duo An, is currently a doctoral student in the laboratories of Dan Luo, Ph.D., and Minglin Ma, Ph.D., both of the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell. When he was a summer intern, An was making nanoclay hydrogels, injecting one solution into another to create a gel. But during one particular procedure, instead of direct injection, he dripped one solution into another. When the first solution entered the second, it created vortex-ring particles.

Eventually, it occurred to An that the vortex-ring particles, or tiny donuts, could be more useful than anyone might have imagined, especially if they contained, well, a filling not a fruit filling, as in a donut for human consumption, but a filling that would help the hydrogel donuts  hit the spot  in biotechnology applications as varied as cell encapsulation, three-dimensional cell culture, and cell-free protein production.

These possibilities were outlined in an article that appeared August 4 in the journal Nature Communications. The article,  Mass Production of Shaped Particles Through Vortex Ring Freezing,  describes how stable hydrogel or solid microparticles of a defined shape can be produced through a gelation or precipitation process. ( Freezing  in the article s title may be read as  gelation. )

According to the article, which was contributed by a group of scientists led by Drs. Luo and Ma, controlling the shape and speed of a fluid spray, as well as the speed of the chemical reaction within the spray s droplets, could yield different structures.

 During its formation, the fluid experiences a rich variety of intriguing geometrical intermediates from spherical to toroidal,  wrote the article s authors.  Here we show that these constantly changing intermediates can be  frozen  at controlled time points into particles with various unusual and unprecedented shapes. 

The Cornell researchers exploited their electrospraying technique to mass produce inorganic and organic particles, with their sizes well controlled from hundreds of microns to millimeters. Multitudes of vortex ring-derived particles (VRPs) were produced, up to 15,000 rings per minute, then frozen at precise time points.

 Guided further by theoretical analyses and a laminar multiphase fluid flow simulation, we show that this freezing approach is applicable to a broad range of materials from organic polysaccharides to inorganic nanoparticles,  the authors continued.  Moreover, compartmentalization and ordered-structures composed of these novel particles are all achieved, creating opportunities to engineer more sophisticated hierarchical materials. 

Dr. Ma admitted that the concept of using a doughnut-shaped encapsulation hadn't occurred to him, but made perfect sense: ""We knew the concept that a doughnut shape is better, but we never thought of making it until we saw it [from An].""

An advantage of the doughnut-shaped encapsulation over a spherical-shaped one is shorter diffusion distance the distance the encapsulated particle must travel to escape the capsule while at the same time maintaining a relatively large surface area.

This concept could pave the way for other as-yet-unknown applications of vortex ring freezing, according to Dr. Luo. For example, the Cornell scientists employed nanoclay hydrogel donut-microVRPs to encapsulate DNA molecules for improved cell-free protein production. The group s previous work had shown that the bulk nanoclay hydrogel protects DNA from DNase and hence enhances the cell-free protein production yield. Compared with a bulk nanoclay hydrogel, the donut-microVRP have a much higher surface area for mass transfer and are therefore ideal for protein production applications.

""Our hope is that this type of material in these shapes can be used much more extensively in other labs for whatever they're trying to do,"" noted Dr. Luo. ""There is a whole field devoted to just particles, but by default, they are all thinking in terms of spherical particles. Hopefully, this will add to that field of study.""","Pharmaceuticals"

A greater understanding of these defensive pathways would allow scientists to develop therapies that could precisely modulate the immune response in the treatment of virulent pathogens.

Now, immunologists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have identified the protein trigger in the body's quick-reaction innate immune system that specifically recognizes the influenza virus in infected cells and triggers their death. The researchers believe that the protein they identified called ZBP1 could provide much-needed hope for developing drugs to protect against influenza's sometimes lethal complication of pneumonia.

Viral pneumonia from influenza is often exacerbated by lung inflammation and cell damage caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system. The development of new therapies that would modulate ZBP1's action could allow the body to fight the virus by killing infected cells, but preventing that overreaction.

In the new study, the investigators sought to understand how the body's innate immune system is alerted to the presence of the virus and mobilizes to trigger infected cells to commit suicide. The innate immune system triggers the body's ""emergency response"" to invaders such as infections. This rapid attack gives the body's adaptive immune system time to generate antibodies that specifically target the virus or bacterium. Flu vaccines train this adaptive immune system to attack specific viral strains.

First, the research team uncovered the specific machinery that the innate immune system uses to induce cell suicide as controlled by type I interferon. Subsequently, the researchers began to search for the protein molecule that recognizes the virus and triggers the cell death machinery. Their experiments used cells from genetically altered mouse strains, in which genes for particular proteins are removed selectively, to discover whether the cells lacking that protein would commit suicide when infected with influenza.

Amazingly, they found that cells lacking ZBP1 were completely resistant to viral-induced cell death. The result was surprising because ZBP1 was known to sense foreign DNA in the cell, but the influenza virus uses RNA as its genetic material.

""Our discovery was totally unexpected,"" explained senior study author Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology. ""We never thought we would actually identify this molecule to be important in influenza viral infection because there is no DNA stage in the influenza life cycle.""

Further experiments revealed that ZBP1 was, indeed, a ""master assassin"" in the cell, responsible for triggering three separate cell-death pathways. Moreover, the team discovered that ZBP1 was particular for recognizing influenza. The sensor did not trigger cell death in response to other similar viruses or bacteria

The findings from this study were published recently in Science Immunology in an article entitled  ZBP1/DAI Is an Innate Sensor of Influenza Virus Triggering the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death Pathways. 

The St. Jude s team work also revealed that ZBP1 acts as a protein detector, not a DNA detector, sensing telltale viral-produced proteins in the infected cell. The scientists moved their studies into Zbp1-knockout mice strains infected with influenza. Due to the fact that the innate immune system wasn't killing off infected cells, the mice showed an increased viral load and delayed recovery. However, because the immune system wasn't able to overreact, the mice showed reduced lung inflammation and damage to lung cells and were protected from mortality.

""Since the pathology that we saw in the mice matches what is seen in humans, we will now explore translating these findings to humans,"" Dr. Kanneganti noted. ""If we can somehow modulate the activation of this pathway, then that will help to decrease the exaggerated inflammatory response that causes mortality during influenza infection.""

Lead author Teneema Kuriakose, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Kanneganti s laboratory, added that the timing of such drug treatment would be extremely critical, stating that  ZBP1 does an amazing job of killing off infected cells, but it would be very useful to modulate ZBP1 in later stages of the infection, when the uncontrolled inflammation causes damage.""

""We have shown that these molecules are important in viral infections, but now we want to test their role in other inflammatory conditions,"" Dr. Kanneganti concluded. ""ZBP1 is likely not dedicated to attacking only the influenza virus. Maybe it also plays other roles, and if we fully understand those roles, we can learn how to manipulate immune responses.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The amines are one of the most important classes of chemical compounds today. Amines that contain a ring-like aryl group are used widely in pharmaceuticals, such as the top-selling drugs Abilify    (aripiprazole), Crestor  (rosuvastatin), Gleevec  (imatinib mesylate), and Lidoderm  (lidocaine patch 5%). The process of making different amines (amination) involves connecting an amine to an organic molecule. The amine itself must first be prepared in advance by the hydrogenation of anilines, which are used as a nitrogen source and are derived from nitroarenes.

Xile Hu, Ph.D., and Chi Wai Cheung, Ph.D., at EPFL developed a technique for making (hetero)aryl amines through the reductive coupling of nitroarenes with organic compounds, without needing to go through the aniline step first. Using an iron catalyst, the researchers were able to couple amines to a number of alkyl halides, a group of organic compounds widely used in commercial products.

 The method was shown to have a high tolerance to functional groups, including some that require protection under conventional amine synthesis, making them versatile and well suited for a broad range of applications, according to the investigators.

The new method allows chemists to synthesize alkyl or aryl amines directly from nitroarenes, which are often cheaper than anilines. Moreover, using nitroarenes directly is more step-economical than using anilines, because the latter have to be derived from nitroarenes anyway, add the scientists. In addition, certain anilines containing are difficult to produce, while their corresponding nitroarenes are readily available.

""From these points of view, the current method can be considered as a valuable alternative to the conventional amination methods such as direct alkylation and reductive amination,"" said Dr.Hu.","Pharmaceuticals"

ProNAi said it incurred a one-time $2.8 million restructuring charge toward estimated close-out expenses for PNT2258.

The restructuring comes two months after the company revealed in June that PNT2258 showed only modest efficacy in the Phase II Wolverine trial, assessing the candidate in 61 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

ProNAi immediately suspended development of PNT2258 in DLBCL, after interim results showed a response rate of 8.1% overall and 15.8% in a subgroup of 19 patients with a performance status of 0-1, who were exposed to one to three prior systemic regimens and received at least eight doses of PNT2258 within 35 days of starting therapy. No response was seen in 10 patients with a performance status of 2 and/or four or more prior lines of therapy enrolled before the eligibility criteria were amended, nor in eight additional patients enrolled after the April 25 data cutoff date for the interim analysis.

PNT2258 won the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation for DLBCL in March, and earlier received a similar designation from the European Commission.

ProNai has shifted its R&D focus to advancing PNT141, a selective, oral small-molecule inhibitor of the Cdc7 kinase. According to ProNAi, PNT141 is a key regulator of both DNA replication and DNA damage response, making it a compelling emerging target for the potential treatment of a broad range of tumor types.

Black sigatoka, along with a couple of closely related banana diseases, is so devastating it could bring back an old song: Yes! We Have No Bananas.

Legend has it the song was inspired by shortages another banana variety, the Gros Michel. Like the Cavendish, the Gros Michel was genetically uniform and vulnerable to blight. Ultimately it was taken out of cultivation, even though it was widely considered tastier than the Cavendish.

Could the Cavendish avoid the fate of the Gros Michel? Maybe, with the help of gene-sequencing technology, which has been used to unravel the DNA of P. fijiensis. Gene sequencing has also been used to discover how P. fijiensis and two closely related pathogens, P. musae and P. eumusae, have evolved into a lethal threat to the world s bananas. P. musae causes yellow sigatoka disease, and P. eumusae causes eumasae leaf spot disease. Of the three pathogens, P. fijiensis poses the greatest constraint to banana production worldwide.

By studying the genomes of these pathogenic fungi, scientists hope to find ways to ensure the sustainable production of the banana, the world s leading fruit crop. At present, the banana ranks fourth as a global staple food, with 140 million tons of bananas produced annually in subtropical and tropical regions. The banana industry could, however, be wiped out in just 5 10 years by fast-advancing fungal diseases. Already, the Sigatoka disease complex can reduce banana yields by 50 70%, if not controlled.

Genomic details of the pathogens threatening the banana appeared August 11 in the journal PLOS Genetics, in an article entitled,  Combating a Global Threat to a Clonal Crop: Banana Black Sigatoka Pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis (Synonym Mycosphaerella fijiensis) Genomes Reveal Clues for Disease Control."" The article, which was contributed by scientists based at the University of California (UC) Davis, and Wageningen University, suggested genomic insights could suggest ways to improve host resistance. Such insights could also inform sophisticated management of fungicide resistance in the pathogen.

 In the P. fijiensis genome sequence, we identified an effector that induced an HR [hypersensitive response]-like necrosis on a resistant banana accession but not on a susceptible cultivar,  wrote the article s authors.  If validated, this assay may be useful for identifying resistance in banana breeding programs. 

The authors also reported that the genomic sequence was used to develop highly polymorphic molecular markers for analyzing P. fijiensis field populations and to identify a strong enrichment (nearly 100%) for fungicide resistance markers in fungicide-treated banana plantations compared to untreated wild-type populations.  This rapid evolution of fungicide resistance poses an immediate threat to sustainable banana production,  the authors noted. They added, however, that the P. fijiensis genome could aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat the black sigatoka pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs.

Black sigatoka is airborne and affects the leaves of banana plants in small- and large-scale plantations, and without chemical control it results in huge yield losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the fruit, causing premature ripening.

""Black sigatoka has a huge social, ecological, and economic impact worldwide,  explained Gert Kema, professor in tropical phytopathology at Wageningen University.  Thanks to the sequencing of the DNA of the Pseudocercospora fungus, we are now gaining a greater insight into the interaction between the fungus and the banana plant. This provides us with leads for increasing the sustainability of banana cultivation, making it better for the environment, the local population, and the economy. For example, the insights offer us opportunities to develop a banana plant that is suitable for production and export, and which is also resistant against black sigatoka.""

This fresh understanding of the DNA of the black sigatoka fungus is also providing new information that is useful in the development of more effective and, hopefully, less environmentally unfriendly crop protection products. This could reduce the amount of fungicide spraying, which, in turn, would improve the quality of life of the people working in the plantations and those who live in the immediate surroundings.

""We have discovered that the two more destructive pathogens share a pattern of parallel changes in their core metabolic pathways that enables them to exploit more efficiently the nutrient resources available in banana,"" added UC Davis molecular plant pathologist Ioannis Stergiopoulos. ""Now, for the first time, we understand the genomic basis of the evolution of virulence in these fungal diseases, thus giving us an opportunity for intervention.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Now, scientists at the University of Cambridge found that CMV alters gene expression in the tomato plants it infects, causing changes to volatile airborne chemicals the scent emitted by the plants.

Most interestingly, the researchers found that bees could smell these subtle changes, as glasshouse experiments have shown that bumblebees prefer the infected plants over healthy ones. The Cambridge team believes that by indirectly manipulating bee behavior to improve pollination of infected plants by changing their scent, the virus is effectively paying its host back. Yet, this is not an altruistic mechanism, because it seemingly aids the spread of the pollen to susceptible plants, inhibiting the chance of virus-resistant plant strains emerging.

The authors of this new study, which was published recently in PLOS Pathogens in an article entitled  Virus Infection of Plants Alters Pollinator Preference: A Payback for Susceptible Hosts?  say that understanding the smells that attract bees, and reproducing these artificially by using similar chemical blends, may enable growers to protect or even enhance yields of bee-pollinated crops.

""Bees provide a vital pollination service in the production of three-quarters of the world's food crops. With their numbers in rapid decline, scientists have been searching for ways to harness pollinator power to boost agricultural yields,"" explained senior study author John Carr, Ph.D., head of Cambridge's virology and molecular plant pathology group. ""Better understanding the natural chemicals that attract bees could provide ways of enhancing pollination and attracting bees to good sources of pollen and nectar which they need for survival.""

CMV, typically transmitted by aphids and not by bees, is one of the most prevalent pathogens affecting tomato plants, resulting in small plants with poor-tasting fruits that can cause serious losses to cultivated crops. Not only is CMV one of the most damaging viruses for horticultural crops, but it also persists in wild plant populations, and the authors say their results suggest why.

""We were surprised that bees liked the smell of the plants infected with the virus it made no sense,  remarked Dr. Carr.  You'd think the pollinators would prefer a healthy plant. However, modeling suggested that if pollinators were biased toward diseased plants in the wild, this could short-circuit natural selection for disease resistance. 

""The virus is rewarding disease-susceptible plants,  he added,  and at the same time producing new hosts it can infect to prevent itself from going extinct. An example, perhaps, of what's known as symbiotic mutualism.""

The investigators describe findings that reveal a new level of complexity in the evolutionary  arms race  between plants and viruses, in which it is traditionally believed that plants continually evolve new forms of disease-resistance while viruses evolve new ways to evade it.

""We would expect the plants susceptible to disease to suffer, but in making them more attractive to pollinators the virus gives these plants an advantage,  noted Dr. Carr.  Our results suggest that the picture of a plant-pathogen arms race is more complex than previously thought, and in some cases, we should think of viruses in a more positive way. 

The blend of volatile organic compounds that plants emit has evolved to perform multiple functions, attracting pollinators and repulsing plant-eating animals and microbes. In the current study, the Cambridge team grew plants in individual containers and collected air with emissions from CMV-infected plants, as well as mock-infected control plants. Using mass spectrometry, the researchers could see the change in emissions induced by the virus. More importantly, they found that bumblebees could smell the changes.

""Bees are far more sensitive to the blends of volatiles emitted by plants and can detect very subtle differences in the mix of chemicals,  Dr. Carr stated.  In fact, they can even be trained to detect traces of chemicals emitted by synthetic substances, including explosives and drugs. 

Finally, the researchers used mathematical modeling to show how pollinator bias for infected plants can cause genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations over vast numbers of generations. With the global population estimated to reach nine billion people by 2050, producing enough food will be one of this century's greatest challenges. The researchers hope that their work will help address issues surrounding food security at local, national, and international scales.","Pharmaceuticals"

These so-called induced pluripotent stem cells won Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in medicine just 6 years later for their promise in research and medicine. Since then, researchers have discovered other ways to convert cells between different types. This is mostly done by introducing many extra copies of ""master switch"" genes that produce proteins that turn on entire genetic networks responsible for producing a particular cell type.

Now the Duke team has developed a strategy that avoids the need for the extra gene copies. Instead, a modification of the CRISPR genetic engineering technique is used to directly turn on the natural copies already present in the genome. These early results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete and persistent conversion than the method where new genes are permanently added to the genome. These cells could be used for modeling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines, and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy.

The study (""Targeted Epigenetic Remodeling of Endogenous Loci by CRISPR/Cas9-Based Transcriptional Activators Directly Converts Fibroblasts to Neuronal Cells"") is published in Cell Stem Cell.

""This technique has many applications for science and medicine. For example, we might have a general idea of how most people's neurons will respond to a drug, but we don't know how your particular neurons with your particular genetics will respond,"" said Charles Gersbach, Ph.D., the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and director for the Center of Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering at Duke. ""Taking biopsies of your brain to test your neurons is not an option. But if we could take a skin cell from your arm, turn it into a neuron, and then treat it with various drug combinations, we could determine an optimal personalized therapy.""

""The challenge is efficiently generating neurons that are stable and have a genetic programming that looks like your real neurons,"" says Joshua Black, the graduate student in Gersbach's lab who led the work. ""That has been a major obstacle in this area.""

In the 1950s, Conrad Waddington, Ph.D., a British developmental biologist who laid the foundations for developmental biology, suggested that immature stem cells differentiating into specific types of adult cells can be thought of as rolling down the side of a ridged mountain into one of many valleys. With each path a cell takes down a particular slope, its options for its final destination become more limited.

If you want to change that destination, one option is to push the cell vertically back up the mountain. That's the idea behind reprogramming cells to be induced pluripotent stem cells. Another option is to push it horizontally up and over a hill and directly into another valley.

""If you have the ability to specifically turn on all the neuron genes, maybe you don't have to go back up the hill,"" said Dr. Gersbach.

Previous methods have accomplished this by introducing viruses that inject extra copies of genes to produce a large number of master transcription factors. Unique to each cell type, these proteins bind to thousands of places in the genome, turning on that cell type's particular gene network. This method, however, has some drawbacks.

""Rather than using a virus to permanently introduce new copies of existing genes, it would be desirable to provide a temporary signal that changes the cell type in a stable way,"" said Black. ""However, doing so in an efficient manner might require making very specific changes to the genetic program of the cell.""

In the new study, Black, Dr. Gersbach, and colleagues used CRISPR to precisely activate the three genes that naturally produce the master transcription factors that control the neuronal gene network, rather than having a virus introduce extra copies of those genes.

The CRISPR system was administered to mouse fibroblasts in the laboratory. The tests showed that, once activated by CRISPR, the three neuronal master transcription factor genes robustly activated neuronal genes. This caused the fibroblasts to conduct electrical signals--a hallmark of neuronal cells. And even after the CRISPR activators went away, the cells retained their neuronal properties.

""When blasting cells with master transcription factors made by viruses, it's possible to make cells that behave like neurons,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But if they truly have become autonomously functioning neurons, then they shouldn't require the continuous presence of that external stimulus.""

The experiments showed that the new CRISPR technique produced neuronal cells with an epigenetic program at the target genes matching the neuronal markings naturally found in mouse brain tissue.

""The method that introduces extra genetic copies with the virus produces a lot of the transcription factors, but very little is being made from the native copies of these genes,"" explained Black. ""In contrast, the CRISPR approach isn't making as many transcription factors overall, but they're all being produced from the normal chromosomal position, which is a powerful difference since they are stably activated. We're flipping the epigenetic switch to convert cell types rather than driving them to do so synthetically.""

The next steps, according to Black, are to extend the method to human cells, raise the efficiency of the technique, and try to clear other epigenetic hurdles so that it could be applied to model particular diseases.

""In the future, you can imagine making neurons and implanting them in the brain to treat Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative conditions,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But even if we don't get that far, you can do a lot with these in the lab to help develop better therapies.""","Pharmaceuticals"

You have to be really careful how you extract the right signal. Because there is a lot of noise in the data,  he says.

Dr. Subramanian along with Dr. Umar Saif, chairman of the Punjab Information Technology Board, and a team of computer researchers were able to find the signal in the noise from more than 300,000 phone calls about dengue, a virus that is similar in transmission to Zika.

Those calls were to a health hotline set up to improve the surveillance and response times following a 2011 dengue epidemic in the densely populated province of Punjab. In that outbreak 21,000 cases were reported and more than 350 lives lost.

The team analyzed many data sources, some at a fine-grained town level, including call volume, hospital records, and weather conditions that impact the vector lifecycle. What emerged were patterns on case distribution that led to a forecasting idea says Dr. Subramanian. The team created a working dashboard that not only flags outbreaks but also provides an accurate forecast by location two to three weeks ahead of time.

 If you give a signal to a hospital two weeks before an outbreak, it s a big deal,  Dr. Subramanian says. Their results were published in Science Advances.

Hospitals in that region use that lead time to prepare special wards and prevent patient-to-patient spread of the infection and public health officials are able to implement targeted containment activities. The researchers plan to publish follow up data on these efforts.  So far the results have been promising,  he says.

Another study also on dengue transmission in Pakistan published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, found predictive clues in much bigger data more than 40 million mobile phone records. Dengue has been prevalent for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but newly emerging outbreaks in the northeast provided researchers with the opportunity to analyze how and when the disease spreads in a wired world.

The researchers were able to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.

Approximately one dozen genes have variants that are associated with sociability, or with fear and aggression.

The gene variants were uncovered by researchers based at Nationwide Children s Hospital. According to these researchers, reduced-fear gene variants may have been involved in the domestication process. The researchers also assert that their findings are relevant not only to dog behavioral problems, but also to human anxiety disorders.

The new findings appeared August 8 in the journal BMC Genetics, in an article entitled,  Genetic Mapping of Canine Fear and Aggression.  In the near term, the findings could inform genetic tests that would reveal the risk of specific types of fear and aggression in dogs. In the long term, the findings could shed light on human anxiety disorders and aggression, violence, and criminality.

 We conducted genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of breed stereotypes for many fear and aggression traits across several hundred dogs from diverse breeds,  wrote the article s authors.  We confirmed those findings using GWA in a second cohort of partially overlapping breeds. Lastly, we used the validated loci to create a model that effectively predicted fear and aggression stereotypes in a third group of dog breeds that were not involved in the mapping studies. 

The researchers found that known loci variants (IGF1 and HMGA2) for small body size are associated with separation anxiety, touch sensitivity, owner-directed aggression, and dog rivalry. The researchers also notice that two other loci (between GNAT3 and CD36 on chromosome 18, and near IGSF1 on the X chromosome) are associated with several traits, including touch sensitivity, nonsocial fear, and fear and aggression that are directed toward unfamiliar dogs and humans.

""Our strongest focus is on specific genes related to aggression toward unfamiliar humans and dogs, which are associated with highly relevant genes at two genome regions,"" said Carlos Alvarez, Ph.D., principal investigator in the Center for Molecular and Human Genetics in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. ""Those genes are consistent with the core fear and aggression neural pathway known as the amygdala to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.""

Because these risk variants are common across dog breeds, the canine veterinary setting provides an ideal test bed for new therapies targeting those biochemical pathways. Once it is determined which neuronal circuits are affected by the risk variation, this will likely reveal drug targets that could be inhibited or activated to increase or decrease the emotional behavioral effects. Those findings can immediately be tested in pet dog patients under owner consent. And, if those therapies are effective in dogs, they can then be applied to humans with similar conditions. Knowledge of the affected pathways will also provide biomarkers that can be used to identify the patients who are most likely to respond to such treatments.

""This project has only just begun,"" noted Dr. Alvarez. ""We are continuing to identify and validate other genes associated with these traits, including the expansion of dog breeds studied and biological validation of the findings. We are excited about what this work will continue to uncover.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, can it be true that various microbes that constitute the oral microbiota negatively affect colorectal cancer (CRC)? A new study led by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has found evidence strongly suggesting that they can.

While some previous evidence alluded to common mouth bacteria worsening CRC in animals, it had not been clear how these microbes made their way to the gut to exert their adverse effects. In the new study, the Harvard investigators found evidence that microbes called fusobacteria might use the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors. Moreover, the research team was able to show exactly how these bacteria home in on colorectal tumors causing them to proliferate and subsequently accelerate colorectal cancer.

""As fusobacteria contribute to colon tumor development, revealing the mechanism that guides them to the tumor and why fusobacteria become abundant there might inform ways of blocking this,"" explained co-senior study author Wendy Garrett, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Center. ""Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, if we know how fusobacteria localize and become enriched in colon tumors, hopefully, we can utilize the same or similar mechanisms to guide and deliver cancer therapeutics to colon tumors.""

CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and microbes have recently begun to emerge as key factors influencing the development and progression of the disease. Recent studies have shown that fusobacteria promote the formation of colon tumors in animals and are enriched in human colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. But these studies left it unclear how bacteria from the mouth localize to, and become abundant in, colorectal tumors.

The research team had a suspicion that oral microbes might reach colorectal tumors through the bloodstream. To test this idea, the scientists injected fusobacteria into the tail veins of two mouse models with either precancerous or malignant colorectal tumors. Surprisingly, in both types of mice, the fusobacteria became enriched in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. The researchers also detected fusobacteria in the majority of human colorectal cancer metastases tested, but not in most samples taken from tumor-free liver biopsies.

The findings from this study were published recently in Cell Host & Microbe in an article entitled  Fap2 Mediates Fusobacterium nucleatum Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Enrichment by Binding to Tumor-Expressed Gal-GalNAc. 

Using human samples and mouse models, the researchers went on to discover that the Fap2 protein located on the surface of fusobacteria recognizes a sugar called Gal-GalNac, which is abundant on the surface of colorectal tumor cells.

 We identify a host polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that explicates fusobacteria abundance in CRC,  the authors wrote.  Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized by fusobacterial Fap2, which functions as a Gal-GalNAc lectin. 

Additional experiments showed that Fap2 mediates fusobacterial colonization of colorectal cancer tumors and metastases. Recent studies have demonstrated that this protein also impairs the ability of the host immune system to kill tumor cells. Taken together, the findings suggest that fusobacteria travel through the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors and then use their Fap2 protein to bind to host cells and proliferate in tumors, thereby accelerating colorectal cancer.

 F. nucleatum binding to clinical adenocarcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment,  the authors wrote.  Clinical fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or inactivated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells and established CRCs in mice. 

""The strengths are that the study involved both human samples and mouse models. The weakness is that the available mouse models for colorectal adenocarcinoma do not completely reflect the slowly developing disease in humans,"" noted co-senior study author Gilad Bachrach, Ph.D., associate professor in the Institute of Dental Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""Based on our findings, it's too early to say whether we can prevent mouth bacteria from traveling through blood to the colon and promoting tumor formation or if some people are more at risk than others.""

In future studies, the researchers will look to examine further how fusobacteria contribute to the development, growth, and spread of colorectal cancer. ""Although it may not be possible to prevent oral microbes from entering the bloodstream and reaching colorectal tumors, our findings suggest that drugs targeting either Fap2 or Gal-GalNac could potentially prevent these bacteria from exacerbating colorectal cancer,"" Dr. Garrett concluded.","Pharmaceuticals"

The deal is designed to expand Mallinckrodt s hospital products portfolio with developmental products that include the StrataGraft  regenerative skin tissue and a technology platform for genetically enhanced skin tissues.

StrataGraft is being developed as the first biological ""off-the-shelf"" skin substitute product for treatment of severe, deep, partial-thickness burns an alternative to current standard of care for second- and third-degree burns, which requires autograft.

StrataGraft is in Phase III development for treatment of severe, deep, partial-thickness burns, with an FDA approval decision anticipated by 2020. The product is also in Phase II development for treatment of severe, full-thickness burns. StrataGraft received the FDA s orphan designation in 2012.

Mallinckrodt and Stratatech added that the technology platform offers the potential for new products through topically applied, genetically enhanced tissues designed to produce elevated levels of natural wound healing and antimicrobial factors. The platform is in Phase I development in diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers, with other potential applications under consideration.

 We believe Stratatech's technology has the potential to transform the standard of treatment for wound care. Additionally, the acquisition will bring world-class Stratatech researchers with deep expertise in cell-based, differentiated regenerative medicine to Mallinckrodt's research team,  Mallinckrodt CEO and President Mark Trudeau said in a statement.

Mallinckrodt reasons that Stratatech s progenitor keratinocyte technology platform provides potential for new products through genetically enhanced tissues, applied topically, that produce elevated levels of natural wound healing and antimicrobial factors.  StrataGraft is in Phase I development in diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers, with other potential applications being considered.

 In our next phase of development, the unique cell line used to produce living tissue in StrataGraft can also be genetically modified to potentially increase production of a variety of factors to support and promote wound healing, such as antimicrobial and vascular endothelial growth factors. This could offer utility in a number of skin injury settings beyond burns,  added Stratatech CEO Lynn Allen-Hoffmann, Ph.D.

Dr. Allan-Hoffman founded privately held Stratatech in 2001, telling GEN 8 years later that she was inspired to pursue tissue engineering while watching a patient with third-degree burns covering 95% of his body receive painful grafts of his own skin:  That was my epiphany day, when I refocused my efforts to develop a cell line that could be clinically useful. 

Mallinckrodt said its planned acquisition of StrataSys will result in  slight  dilution to the company's near- and longer-term adjusted diluted earnings per share. However, the buyer did not offer guidance concerning the effect of the deal on its GAAP diluted EPS  due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of items that would be included in calculating such impact.

""This could allow us to investigate questions such as why some people genetically predisposed to a disease are protected from it? Why events during early life and adolescence have such a lasting impact on brain health? Is it possible to 'reset' gene expression in the human brain?""

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important regulators of gene transcription, and one group of HDACs has been linked to important brain disorders. Several established neuropsychiatric drugs are HDAC inhibitors, and others are currently being studied as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Martinostat was developed in Dr. Hooker's laboratory and is patterned after known HDAC inhibitors to bind to HDAC molecules tightly in the brain.

PET scans with Martinostat of the brains of eight healthy human volunteers revealed characteristic patterns of uptake, reflecting HDAC expression levels, that were consistent among all participants. HDAC expression was almost twice as high in gray matter as in white matter. Within gray matter structures, uptake was highest in the hippocampus and amygdala and lowest in the putamen and cerebellum. Experiments with brain tissues from humans and baboons confirmed Martinostat's binding to HDAC, and studies with neural progenitor stem cells revealed specific genes regulated by this group of HDACs, many of which are known to be important in brain health and disease.

""HDAC dysregulation has been implicated in a growing number of brain diseases, so being able to study HDAC regulation both in the normal brain and through the progression of disease should help us better understand disease processes,"" says Dr. Hooker, who is an associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.

These communities composed primarily of bacteria outnumber all of the cells of the human body and work symbiotically with our systems, like a harmonious Lilliputian army hell-bent on keeping Gulliver running in tip-top shape.

Yet, as is often the case during various times in our lives, our biological systems run amok caused from either the relatively benign like an infection from a microbial pathogen, not unlike those that constitute our microbiomes, or from our cells turning against the collective and branching out on their own accord. It has come to the attention of many scientists in recent years that many of these biological perturbations have a link to the microbiome, either directly or indirectly. Even seemingly distant and somewhat disconnected systems such as the brain and the lumen of the intestinal tract have become inextricably linked to disorders like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, autism, and mood disorders.

Although killer T cells are known to give cancer cells a pass early in tumor development, it is unclear whether they wink at driver mutations from the start, or whether they surveil these genetic aberrations before turning a blind eye. According to new research from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, killer T cells are vigilant at first, but soon become inattentive. This finding raises the possibility that killer T cells could regain their sense of mission, enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapies against cancer.

The new research appeared August 9 in the journal Immunity, in an article entitled,  Tumor-Specific T Cell Dysfunction Is a Dynamic Antigen-Driven Differentiation Program Initiated Early during Tumorigenesis.  This article describes how preclinical cancers were studied in mice to reveal the killer T-cell response. The killer T cells, the article explained, not only recognize changes that drive cancer, they also attempt to launch an immune attack on cancerous cells.

 Early during the pre-malignant phase of tumorigenesis, TST [tumor-specific CD8+ T] cells became dysfunctional, exhibiting phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional features similar to dysfunctional T cells isolated from late-stage human tumors,  wrote the article s authors.  Thus, T cell dysfunction seen in advanced human cancers may already be established early during tumorigenesis. Although the TST cell dysfunctional state was initially therapeutically reversible, it ultimately evolved into a fixed state. 

The authors added that persistent antigen exposure, rather than factors associated with the tumor microenvironment, drove dysfunction. Moreover, the authors indicated that TST cell differentiation and dysfunction program exhibited features distinct from T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections.

""Our results highlight that driver mutations, which theoretically would be the most effective antigens to target because they represent the basis for a tumor behaving as a tumor, are not immunologically silent and can indeed be recognized,"" said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center immunologist Phil Greenberg, M.D., who led the study along with Andrea Schietinger, Ph.D., a former Fred Hutch postdoctoral research fellow who now leads an immunotherapy lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

As we use a natural lure namely human odor in our approach there is no negative impact on the environment, and it is very improbable that the mosquitoes will become 'resistant' to being captured. After all, the mosquitoes need their attraction to the lure in order to be able to survive.""

The findings from this new study were published recently in The Lancet in an article entitled  The Effect of Mass Mosquito Trapping on Malaria Transmission and Disease burden (SolarMal): A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Trial. 

The success of the new malaria control approach lies in its combinatorial strategy of using the odor-baited traps with mosquito nets, antimalaria drugs, and a solid social strategy. The traps require electricity to operate, but there is no central power supply on Rusinga, an island in Lake Victoria, so solar panels were installed on the roofs of homes. These not only provided electricity for the mosquito traps but also provided the homes with power for light and to charge a mobile phone. The use of solar energy to control malaria gave rise to the project name: SolarMal.

Thanks to this combined approach, all 25,000 inhabitants of Rusinga participated in the study. When the odor-baited traps are used, the use of insecticides to combat the mosquito population can be minimized avoiding any harmful side effects of such products. The Wageningen antimalaria approach, therefore, has had not only benefits in reducing the spread of malaria but also had positive effects on the living conditions of the population.

While the mortality rate due to malaria infections especially in children under the age of five still rank the disease as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, it is the morbidity associated with malaria that often gets overlooked, costing Africa $12 billion a year in health-care costs and lost productivity, particularly in the agricultural sector.

""The effect of the disease on agricultural production is hugely underestimated,"" Dr. Takken noted. ""As children with malaria need access to hospital care, their parents cannot work on the land and as a result food production rates decline. If those parents themselves also suffer from malaria infections four or five times a year, they are also not able to work for around 6 weeks. In such cases, extra labor needs to be brought in, or the crop will be lost. An African household loses 10% of its annual incomes through malaria. It is for good reason that reducing the prevalence of malaria was included in the ten-millennium development goals formulated by the UN.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) is aiming to eradicate malaria by 2030. To that end, investments are being made in the development of vaccines against the parasite and in combating the vectors of the parasite: the mosquitoes. The odor-baited trap dubbed the Suna trap represents an efficient and safe solution in the fight against the mosquito.","Pharmaceuticals"

""We have figured out a way to mine these data for the benefit of cancer patients.""

Dr. Okimoto and collaborators developed a computational algorithm called the Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by ITeration (JAMMIT), which uses advanced mathematics to identify different patterns across multiple molecular data types, such as gene expression and genetic mutations, that when taken together accurately predict what treatments would be best for a given cancer patient.

""The algorithm could accelerate the approval of powerful treatments for many cancers, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs for treating cancer. I believe this discovery can open a path to more precision medicine clinical trials that could be initated and run locally in Hawaii,"" said Randall Holcombe, M.D., incoming Director of the UH Cancer Center.

The findings (""Joint Analysis of Multiple High-Dimensional Data Types Using Sparse Matrix Approximations of Rank-1 with Applications to Ovarian and Liver Cancer""), published in Biodata Mining, highlight JAMMIT analysis of ovarian and liver cancer data pulled from private research labs and public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. The analysis identified small sets of genes that accurately predict which patients would benefit most from chemotherapy. These same signatures also suggest that many of the ovarian and liver cancer patients studied would benefit from combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Dr. Okimoto plans on analyzing the data for dozens of more cancers.

The liver cancer results were based in part on tissue samples collected locally by the liver cancer working group (TeamLiver), which includes about 15 researchers and physicians from the Cancer Center and local hospitals that make up the Hawaii Cancer Consortium collaborating on liver cancer research for more than 4 years. Hawaii has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation and the second highest liver cancer mortality rate in the U.S.","Pharmaceuticals"

Overweight mice treated with these nanoparticles lost 10% of their body weight over 25 days  without showing any negative side effects.

The drugs work by transforming white adipose tissue, which is made of fat-storing cells, into brown adipose tissue, which burns fat. The drugs also stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in fat tissue, which positively reinforces the nanoparticle targeting and aids in the white-to-brown transformation.

These drugs, which are not FDA approved to treat obesity, are not new, but the research team developed a novel method to deliver them so that they accumulate in fatty tissues, helping to avoid unwanted side effects in other parts of the body.

""The advantage here is now you have a way of targeting it [the drug] to a particular area and not giving the body systemic effects. You can get the positive effects that you'd want in terms of antiobesity but not the negative ones that sometimes occur,"" says Robert Langer, Sc.D., the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.

Dr. Langer and his colleagues have shown that promoting angiogenesis can help transform adipose tissue and lead to weight loss in mice. However, drugs that promote angiogenesis can be harmful to the rest of the body.

To try to overcome these harmful effects, Dr. Langer and Omid Farokhzad, M.D., director of the Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Biomaterials at Brigham and Women's Hospital, turned to the nanoparticle drug-delivery strategy they have developed in recent years to treat cancer and other diseases. By targeting these particles to the disease site, they say they can deliver a powerful dose while minimizing the drug's accumulation in other areas.

The researchers designed the particles to carry the drugs in their hydrophobic cores, bound to a polymer known as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which is used in many other drug-delivery particles and medical devices. They packaged two different drugs within the particles rosiglitazone, which has been approved to treat diabetes but is not widely used due to adverse side effects, and an analog of prostaglandin. Both drugs activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which stimulates angiogenesis and adipose transformation.

The outer shell of the nanoparticles consists of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer embedded with targeting molecules that guide the particles to the correct destination. These targeting molecules bind to proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels that surround adipose tissue.

The researchers tested the particles in mice that had become obese after being fed a high-fat diet. The mice lost about 10% of their body weight, and their levels of cholesterol and triglycerides  also dropped. The mice also became more sensitive to insulin. (Obesity often leads to insulin insensitivity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes). The mice did not show any side effects from the treatment, which was delivered every other day for 25 days.

With the current system, the particles are injected intravenously, which could make this approach suitable for morbidly obese patients who are at significant risk of obesity-related diseases, says Dr. Farokhzad. ""For it to be more broadly applicable for treatment of obesity, we have to come up with easier ways to administer these targeted nanoparticles, such as orally,"" he says.

The challenge to delivering nanoparticles orally is that it is difficult for them to penetrate the lining of the intestines. In a previous study, however, Drs. Langer and Farokhzad developed a nanoparticle coated with antibodies that bind to receptors found on surfaces of cells lining the intestine, allowing the nanoparticles to be absorbed through the digestive tract. More recently, Dr. Farokhzad and colleagues have developed another orally delivered nanoparticle that uses transferrin, a protein involved in the transport of iron in the body, to facilitate active transport of nanoparticles across the intestine.

The researchers also hope to find more specific adipose tissue targets for the nanoparticles, which could further reduce the possibility of side effects, and they may also investigate using other drugs with lower toxicity.","Pharmaceuticals"

Bohen added that AstraZeneca expects to present data from SELECT-1 at a forthcoming medical meeting, adding:  We remain committed to further developing treatments in the lung cancer setting, such as our immunotherapy combinations and targeted EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor] treatments. 

SELECT-1 represents selumetinib s second Phase III failure in as many years. In July 2015, AstraZeneca said the candidate did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in the Phase III SUMIT study assessing selumetinib with dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

Selumetinib (also known as AZD6244 and ARRY-142886) is an inhibitor of MEK  , a critical component of the RAS-ERK pathway, activation of which is implicated in driving cancer growth and progression, including in patients with KRASm NSCLC.

Selumetinib is also under study for adjuvant treatment of patients with stage III or IV differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), for which the treatment received the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation in May, and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

AstraZeneca said it remained committed to developing selumetinib, including in Phase III trials in patients with DTC, and in a U.S. National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase II registration trial in pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1 patients.

AstraZeneca acquired exclusive worldwide rights to selumetinib from Array BioPharma in 2003 in return for the pharma giant agreeing to pay Array $10 million upfront, research funding, potential development milestones of over $85 million, depending upon the number of successfully commercialized products, and royalties on product sales.","Pharmaceuticals"

Now scientists at the Wellcome Trust, Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), University of York, University of Washington, and the University of Glasgow have identified a chemical that can cure three of these neglected diseases in mice Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Additionally, the newly developed compound does not harm human cells in laboratory tests, providing a strong starting point for drug development.

""We found that these parasites harbor a common weakness,  explained senior study author Frantisek Supek, Ph.D., research investigator at GNF.  We hope to exploit this weakness to discover and develop a single class of drugs for all three diseases.""

Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis affect 20 million people worldwide and lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually. These eukaryotic parasites commonly referred to as kinetoplastids  share similar biology and genetics, which led the researchers to think it possible to find a single chemical that could destroy all three. The research team uncovered an enzyme common to all three parasites and developed a chemical that binds to the ""target,"" preventing it from functioning.

As part of the research, three million compounds held in the Novartis chemical library were tested by a phenotypic screen against live parasites and the most active were then modified over 3000 times using synthetic chemistry before the most potent one was identified  a compound called GNF6702.

""It's a breakthrough in our understanding of the parasites that cause the three diseases, potentially allowing them to be cured,  noted co-author Jeremy Mottram, Ph.D., chair in pathogen biology at the Centre for Immunology and Infection within the University of York. ""This early-phase drug discovery project will now move toward toxicity testing prior to human trials.""

The findings from this study were published recently in Nature in an article entitled  Proteasome Inhibition for Treatment of Leishmaniasis, Chagas Disease, and Sleeping Sickness. 

Much of the research was performed using in vivo imaging technology and initially focused on human African trypanosomiasis, a disease found in sub-Saharan Africa and transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease gets its more common name from the disturbance of the sleep cycle caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei infecting the brain, causing victims to fall into a coma and die.

Finding a drug that can target the disease in the brain has always been a challenge for scientists, but the research team believes they have made a breakthrough using an animal model of the human disease.

""We were able to detect the parasite in the brain using an imaging system that detects the presence of genetically modified light-emitting parasites,  remarked co-author Elmarie Myburgh, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the department of biology at the University of York. ""We then tested the chemical developed by Novartis using our imaging method, which showed that it could get into the brain and kill the parasites.""

""It is a great example of collaboration between industry and academic partners,  Dr. Myburgh added.  By combining resources and expertise, you can really make significant scientific progress.""

Existing treatments for the three diseases are expensive, often have side effects, and are not very effective. The fact that GNF6702 does not seem to have any adverse effects in mice suggests that it might have fewer side effects than existing drugs, although this will need to be explored in human studies. GNF6702 is now being tested for toxicity before it can be moved into clinical trials.

""These three diseases lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually, yet they receive relatively little funding for research and drug development,  stated Stephen Caddick, Ph.D., director of innovation at the Wellcome Trust.  We hope that our early-stage support for this research will provide a basis for the development of new treatments that could reduce suffering for millions of people in the poorest regions of the world.""","Pharmaceuticals"

But it is also, as has been recently discovered, something that occurs in planarians, invertebrate organisms that split off from the ancestors of mammals around 600 million years ago.

The new find comes from an international team of scientists. In collaboration with Jordi Solana and Nikolaus Rajewsky and other colleagues from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) in Germany and the University of Toronto, Manuel Irimia, a group leader at the Center for Genomic Regulation, examined the shifting patterns of gene activity in stem cells in planarians and reported their results in the journal eLife. Their paper, entitled,  Conserved Functional Antagonism of CELF and MBNL Proteins Controls Stem Cell-Specific Alternative Splicing in Planarians,  appeared August 9.

The scientists noted how curious it is that a stem-cell-specific AS mechanism should be shared across such a wide evolutionary range. The scientists suggested that the mechanism must be very ancient, and that it may be equally important as transcription factors are for giving animal stem cells their unique properties.

 We studied AS in a powerful in vivo model for stem cell biology, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea,"" wrote the article s authors. ""We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. 

The researchers identified splicing processes that operate only in the stem cells of the worms, and identified numerous alternative exons responsible for stem-cell-specific protein variants. Surprisingly, introns were often not removed from the RNA, which meant that no more functioning proteins could be generated. The researchers also found small exon snippets, ""micro exons,"" in fully developed cells.

In subsequent experiments, the scientists switched off the proteins that control AS. One of these proteins is MBNL, which suppresses the production of stem-cell-specific protein variants. They also discovered that the CELF protein counteracts MBNL by stimulating the production of these variants. During development from a stem cell to a tissue cell, the two factors competed for predominance. This interaction between MBNL and CELF has been previously described only in mammalian cells.

""In our study we identified new mechanisms that we weren't aware of from the usual studies into mammalian stem cells. With this knowledge, it's now possible for us to look in a targeted manner for the same processes in human cells,"" said Solana.

""I found it particularly fascinating that it's impossible to understand how MBNL without knowing about the function of CELF,  observed group leader Prof. Nikolaus Rajewsky, who is an expert on the systems biology of RNA.  Maybe other splicing factors compete or cooperate in a similar way.""

The scientists' work also raises fundamental questions about the function of stem cells in animals. ""To find the antagonism between MBNL and CELF in flatworms is interesting from an evolutionary biologist's perspective,  noted Solana.  For the first time, we described mechanisms in stem cells in organisms from extremely distant branches of the evolutionary tree. What we found is probably a fundamental process throughout the animal kingdom.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Pharming said the deal would accelerate its shift into a profitable specialty pharmaceutical company, with its own independent commercial infrastructure that will underpin future growth.

Ruconest, developed by Pharming, is approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. The drug has generated annualized net product sales of approximately $25 million as of the end of the second quarter, within a market Pharming said is valued at about $700 million.

Pharming reasons that it can enter another $700 million market if it can win approval for an additional indication. On July 18, Pharming trumpeted positive results in a Phase II trial of Ruconest for prophylaxis of HAE, with the drug meeting its primary endpoints for both once-weekly and twice-weekly dosing regimens.

Pharming agreed to pay Valeant $60 million upfront upon closing of the deal, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, and up to $65 million in potential payments tied to achieving sales milestones.

The acquisition will be funded through a combination of straight debt and new equity capital of between $80 million and $100 million, the buyer added.

Pharming said it expects Valeant s 11-member Ruconest sales force will join the buyer and continue selling the drug in the U.S. That sales force will be increased, the company said, with Pharming also planning to spend more on medical science liaison personnel and additional marketing activities, including patient advocacy programs and  significant  unconditional support for the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association, its programs, and other HAE centers of excellence in the U.S.

Also planned, Pharming added, is additional spending to make Ruconest available in Canada and Mexico, as well as generating more sales in the E.U., Middle East, and Africa markets that Pharming will take over from Sobi in October.

The deal has already completed prenotification and clearance procedures under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act 1976, Pharming said.

Pharming said it anticipates that the deal will add to its 2016 earnings, and enable the company to reach profitability as much as 3 years earlier than under the license with Valeant.

Valeant acquired North American rights to Ruconest when it acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals last year, in a deal completed April 1, 2015. Salix previously acquired those rights by acquiring Santarus, with which Pharming entered into an agreement in 2010 covering development and commercialization of Ruconest  in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.","Pharmaceuticals"

Through the genome-editing medicine collaboration, Adverum could generate at least $1 million upfront, plus millions more in potential option fees, milestone payments, and royalties.

The companies did not detail which eye diseases they were targeting with new treatments, except to say they were  inherited retinal diseases.  In an investor presentation last month, Editas disclosed two eye disorders Leber congenital amaurosis 10 and ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) within its range of disease applications for CRISPR-based medicines.

Under the companies  Collaboration, Option, and License Agreement, Editas agreed to pay Adverum a $1 million upfront  fee  to evaluate Adverum vectors for use in clinical development, plus an additional option exercise fee of $1 million for an exclusive license to Adverum s next-generation AAV vectors for use in each indication chosen as part of the collaboration.

The companies said they plan to conduct research focused on the testing and optimizing Adverum s AAV vectors for potential Editas genome-editing products for the indications. Editas agreed to fund all preclinical activities related to the collaboration, with an unspecified part of the upfront fee to be credited against that funding.

Editas may exercise its option to develop a first indication until the first anniversary of the collaboration. Editas has until the third anniversary to exercise options for the four other Indications but the latter option would expire by the end of the second anniversary if Editas hasn t pursued an initial indication by then, Adverum stated in a regulatory filing.

For each option Editas exercises, Adverum will be eligible to receive up to a  mid-teen million  dollar amount in development and commercialization milestone payments for the product, plus tiered royalties between the mid-single digits and low teens on net sales, subject to adjustments, Adverum s filing added.

If Editas opts to develop a therapy by using a designated alternative vector, Adverum would receive smaller development milestone payments and tiered royalties for the product.

Editas  latest collaboration is its third in as many weeks. On August 3, the company said it will license from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) intellectual property and technology related to high-fidelity Cas9 nucleases and Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) variants, in a deal of undisclosed value.

Development of effective treatments has been hampered by the lack of good experimental models.

Now, in a new study (""Temporal Resolution of Misfolded Prion Protein Transport, Accumulation, Glial Activation, and Neuronal Death in the Retinas of Mice Inoculated with Scrapie""), published in The American Journal of Pathology, researchers describe the distinct stages of prion disease in the mouse retina and define an experimental model to test therapeutic approaches specifically.

""This work was done in collaboration with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and is an excellent example of how animal disease research can be leveraged to benefit human health,"" commented Heather West Greenlee, Ph.D., an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine. ""It provides important insights into the timeline for key pathologic milestones of prion disease in the retina and a model to study mechanisms of disease progression and evaluate therapeutic interventions.""

The study used an experimental mouse model of the prion disease scrapie to determine the temporal relationship between the transport of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) from the brain to the retina, the accumulation of PrPSc in the retina, the inflammatory response of the surrounding retinal tissue, and the loss of neurons.

It is believed that transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) progression depends on the spread of misfolded protein from one central nervous system structure to another. The investigators injected mouse-adapted scrapie into the brains of mice and studied the movement of misfolded prion protein from the brain into the retina via the optic nerve for up to 153 days postinoculation (dpi), when clinical disease becomes apparent.

By studying prion disease in the retina, which is relatively isolated from the brain, researchers were able to determine the time lag between stages of the disease process and to detect seeding of misfolded protein sequentially in the retina at 60 dpi, followed by accumulation of PrPSc and activation of retinal glia at 90 days, activation of microglia at 105 dpi, and retinal neuronal death at 120 dpi.

Prion diseases, also known as TSEs, are a transmissible protein misfolding disease, which makes them a good model to study common aspects of these diseases. ""Not only will this work contribute to the development of therapy to treat prion disease, but it may also provide important insights into which therapies may be effectively applied to the treatment of other protein misfolding diseases, including Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease,"" explained Dr. Greenlee.

Using this information, it is now possible to evaluate a potential therapy for its ability to interfere with accumulation of protein misfolding, to suppress damaging neuroinflammation, or to prevent death of neurons, she added.

Prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, mad cow disease in cows, and chronic wasting disease in deer.","Pharmaceuticals"

Such message control may well have its uses in sustaining health or yielding to illness, which is why it attracted the interest of scientists based at Duke University. Specifically, these scientists decided to study G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that seemed to counter foundational assumptions about cell signaling.

Classically, it was known that GPCRs located along the plasma membrane inside the cell activate G proteins, which are the molecular switches that transmit signals from external sources into the cell's interior, telling the cell how to function.

The activation process is followed by desensitization, led by a protein called  -arrestin that binds to the receptor, blocking further activation of G proteins and pulling the receptor to the inside of the cell in a process termed internalization or endocytosis. The end result of these two processes is to silence receptor signaling, allowing cellular function to return to baseline.

In recent years, however, scientists learned that some GPCRs continue to signal to G proteins, even after  -arrestin has been deployed and the receptors were internalized in the cellular compartments, called endosomes. These observations challenged the existing understanding of how GPCR signaling works.

In hopes of resolving this quirk of cell signaling, the Duke scientists employed a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based methods in a new study of GPCRs. Ultimately, these scientists, led by Robert Lefkowitz, M.D., a professor at Duke and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, uncovered the existence, functionality, and architecture of previously unknown superstructures of receptors, which they've called supercomplexes or ""megaplexes.""

Details of this work appeared August 4 in the journal Cell, in an article entitled,  GPCR-G Protein- -Arrestin Super-Complex Mediates Sustained G Protein Signaling. 

 These super-complexes or 'megaplexes' more readily form at receptors that interact strongly with  -arrestins via a C-terminal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine phosphorylation sites,  wrote the article s authors.  Single-particle electron microscopy analysis of negative-stained purified megaplexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously binds through its core region with G protein and through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with  -arrestin. 

The megaplexes differ from the typical couplings of the receptors and  -arrestin, binding simultaneously through their core region with G protein and through a tail region with  -arrestin. Because  -arrestin interacts only with the receptor tail, the entire inner surface of the receptor is exposed, enabling the receptor to keep activating the G protein.

""The formation of such megaplexes explains how G proteins can continue to send signals after being internalized by GPCRs,"" said Dr. Lefkowitz. ""This opens a whole world of possibilities yet to be explored to manipulate this duality of signaling from outside and inside the cell for therapeutic benefit.""

Co-lead author Alex R.B. Thomsen added that some previous studies showed that the cells respond differently when G protein signaling occurs from different cellular compartments.

""As a result, pharmaceutical drugs developed in the future, if they are capable of regulating signaling at specific compartments, might be able to better treat certain diseases while having fewer side effects,"" Dr. Thomsen noted. Such research is in its infancy, however, and clinical applications are years away.","Pharmaceuticals"

However, their morning dismay stems from more than just the lack of caffeine and the thought of facing the daily commute. Inflammation symptoms such as joint stiffness for sufferers from inflammatory arthritis are generally worse during waking hours. Now, a new study from investigators at the University of Manchester in the U.K. is seeking to find the connection between the circadian clock and various inflammatory pathways.

The British researchers discovered that a protein created by the body's ""biological clock"" called CRYPTOCHROME actively represses inflammatory pathways within affected limbs during the night. Previous research on this protein has described its anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and could represent potential new opportunities for the development of drugs that may be used to treat inflammatory diseases and conditions, such as arthritis.

""By understanding how the biological clock regulates inflammation, we can begin to develop new treatments, which might exploit this knowledge,"" explained senior study author Julie Gibbs, Ph.D., lecturer at the Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Institute of Human Development within the University of Manchester. ""Furthermore, by adapting the time of day at which current drug therapies are administered, we may be able to make them more effective.""

The research team harvested cells from joint tissue of healthy mice and humans. These cells, called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), are important in the pathology that underlies inflammatory arthritis. Each of these cells keeps a 24-hour rhythm, and when this rhythm was disrupted by knocking out the cryptochrome gene there was an increased inflammatory response

 To investigate mechanistic links between the biological clock and pathways underlying inflammatory arthritis, mice were administered collagen (or saline as a control) to induce arthritis,  the authors wrote.  The treatment provoked an inflammatory response within the limbs, which showed robust daily variation in paw swelling and inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory markers were significantly repressed during the dark phase. 

The findings from this study were published recently in The FASEB Journal in an article entitled  The Circadian Clock Regulates Inflammatory Arthritis. 

The scientists  data suggested that the cryptochrome gene product, the CRYPTOCHROME protein, had significant anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, the research team was interested in testing this hypothesis, so they administered drugs designed to activate the protein to determine if protection against inflammation could be achieved which proved successful.

 The results show that the core clock proteins CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 repressed inflammation within the FLSs, and provide novel evidence that a CRYPTOCHROME activator has anti-inflammatory properties in human cells,  the authors penned.  We conclude that under chronic inflammatory conditions, the clock actively represses inflammatory pathways during the dark phase. This interaction has exciting potential as a therapeutic avenue for treatment of inflammatory disease. 

""This study reminds us that inflammation, typically thought of as chronic and brittle, can, in fact, be nuanced In this case, under the influence of the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, which controls the body's circadian physiology,"" noted Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., editor-in-chief of The FASEB Journal.

This is true for infants born as early as 24 weeks gestation, say the scientists.

 

 How microbes get into the airways and the purpose of this prebirth colonization are still unclear, but the pattern of colonization appears to have an important link to later severe neonatal lung disease.

 

 An early microbial imbalance, or dysbiosis, is predictive for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity. The extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants in this study had an average birth weight of 1 pound, 8 ounces. Researchers found that the ELBW infants who went on to develop life-threatening BPD showed abnormal microbial colonization patterns at birth, as compared to preterm infants who did not get BPD.

 

 ""Right at birth, your respiratory microbiome can possibly predict your risk for BPD,"" said Charitharth Vivek Lal, M.D., assistant professor in the UAB Pediatrics Division of Neonatology and the lead investigator of this study.

 

 The study also suggests that the ""healthy"" pattern of colonization seen in the BPD-resistant ELBW infants, with increased abundance of Lactobacillus, is protective.

 

 ""We speculate that the early airway microbiome may prime the developing pulmonary immune system, and dysbiosis in its development may set the stage for subsequent lung disease,"" the researchers say in their paper (""The Airway Microbiome at Birth"") in Scientific Reports. ""Should a disordered airway microbiome prove to be involved in the pathogenesis of disease, it will be of immediate interest to attempt to develop novel therapeutic interventions.""

 

 Dr. Lal says this is the first unbiased airway microbiome analysis to be done immediately at birth (all the early saline aspirates from the tracheas of the newborns were collected at or within 6 hours of delivery).

 

 It is also the only infant airway microbiome analysis to be validated at a second medical center. After the first group of 23 ELBW infants and 10 full-term infants were studied at the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, UAB Women & Infants Center, samples from a second group of 14 ELBW infants were studied in collaboration with Vineet Bhandari, M.D., at Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia.

 

 About half of the ELBW infants at both sites, all of them extremely preterm, later developed BPD. The differences in the microbiomes between infants who were BPD-resistant and BPD-predisposed were similar for infants in both Birmingham and Philadelphia.

 

 Extremely premature infants are at risk for BPD, which is the most common lung pathology of these tiny infants and a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Adults and children who had BPD as infants have lungs that failed to develop properly and are more prone to worse lung function, asthma, lung infections, and pulmonary hypertension.

 

 The researchers also looked at the airway microbiomes of 18 ELBW infants with established BPD and found that their microbiomes had a decreased diversity of types of microbes. The pattern was very different from those of ELBW infants shortly after birth or full-term infants at birth.

 

 As to specific groups of microbes, the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes bacteria like Escherichia coli, appeared to be involved in BPD pathology, and the genus Lactobaccillus, part of the phylum Firmicutes, appeared to be involved in disease protection.

 

 Dr. Lal and colleagues found decreased Lactobacillus abundance in the airway microbiomes of 10 infants born to mothers who had chorioamnionitis, an infection of the membranes of the placenta and an independent risk factor for BPD, as well as decreased Lactobacillus abundance at birth in the airways of the BPD-predisposed ELBW infants as compared to BPD-resistant infants. Research elsewhere has suggested a beneficial role for Lactobacillus against airway diseases and for lung development.

 

 ""I predict that researchers will study the use of respiratory probiotics, and the role of the gut lung microbiome axis in the future,"" Dr. Lal said.

 

 For five ELBW infants who later developed BPD, the researchers collected periodic airway microbiome samples from birth through 9 weeks and saw extremely similar patterns of change in the microbiomes over time.

 

 As for the source of the microbes, Dr. Lal and colleagues wrote, ""As it is commonly believed that colonization of neonates originates in the birth canal, we were surprised to find that the airway microbiomes of vaginally delivered and caesarean section-delivered neonates were similar, which suggests that the microbial DNA in the airways is probably transplacentally derived, consistent with reports that the placenta has a rich microbiome.""

The researchers speculate that this transmission of bacteria or bacterial DNA to the in utero infant could be via blood or amniotic fluid.","Pharmaceuticals"

Product labels provide limited real estate for manufacturers to communicate certain information about ingredients, sourcing, processing and other aspects of creating a product and bringing it to market. Web-based platforms like Sage Project and SmartLabel offer more easily scalable ways for manufacturers to share all the information consumers demand today.

Sage Project takes the concept of transparency and sharing food information one step further by making this information more easily digestible and understandable through interactive visuals. Visual media have changed the ways consumers seek and share information, including food and products they buy. Consumers may start to expect information shared in more visually appealing ways as manufacturers become more transparent about their products and business practices to build trust with consumers.

Manufacturers should establish a balance with the understanding that they could potentially overwhelm consumers with too much information. A recent report from the Center for Food Integrity also found that consumers tend to look for different information in different places, such as on product labels versus company or third-party websites, which could factor into companies' transparency strategies.

Sage Project, SmartLabel and QR codes are a few of many ways manufacturers can communicate food-related information to consumers. But ultimately, manufacturers should ""go out of your way to listen to your customers and then respond based on what their needs actually are, not what you think they are,"" Sam Slover, cofounder and CEO of the Sage Project, recently told Food Dive.

All of those brands saw their sales decline except Mountain Dew (No. 9), which may be benefiting from a series of marketing campaigns and throwback brand reintroductions. Despite declines in brand value, soda brands remain some of the most widely consumed beverages in the U.S., which means any turnaround for the category could be a game-changer as beverage companies continue to diversify.

RTD tea, bottled water, sports drinks and energy drinks comprised most of the rest of the soft drinks list, and they were among the fastest-growing categories outlined in an IRI report earlier this year. Beverages continue to offer manufacturers significant potential for growth if they can align with the right trends at key moments.

Folgers, Lipton and Nescafe were among the soft drink brands with the highest brand value growth at 33%, 19% and 18%, respectively. Folgers growth could be rebounding from a slow 2015, when the brand was dealing with lagging sales. Smucker had raised prices due to high coffee costs, and competition in the segment increased.

Tropicana, Red Bull and Pepsi posted the largest brand value declines at 15%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Sales dips in the juice category overall impacted Tropicana, one of the best-known brands in the category. Energy drinks continue to grapple with health concerns from consumers and public health advocates, related lawsuits and increased competition from startups entering the segment with natural alternatives and exotic flavors and ingredients.","F&B"

This report cited a 2015 study by The Hartman Group, which found that for the first time, consumers believe their purchasing decisions are more impactful on society than their voting decisions or local community involvement.

This passion explains why issues like locally-sourced ingredients and transparency have become so vital to building trust and establishing a loyal consumer base, which in many cases gives smaller companies an edge.

The report named functional, private label, free-from and fresh as key trends for manufacturers to watch, while local, transparency and discovery were trends for awareness. Smaller manufacturers are often on top of these trends as they tend to develop new products and bring products to market faster.

Acquiring smaller competitors that are either positioned in promising categories referred to as scope expansion or threaten the acquiring company's market share known as scale expansion is still a key method for fostering growth among larger companies. However, for that growth to be profitable, acquisitions may need to be more strategic and potentially based in early venture capital investments.

This can cut down on the higher multiples an acquiring company might have to offer later on when the acquisition target is more developed. But it also often means starting due diligence earlier and potentially going more in-depth, such as by using big data, to assess risk in these startup investments.","F&B"

","http://www.fooddive.com/news/why-accounting-errors-wont-stop-hain-takeover-speculation-or-6-hungry-po/423993/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 06:43:22 -0400","NA","Why accounting errors won't stop Hain takeover speculation   or 6 hungry potential buyersHain Celestial has been the focal point of food and beverage industry takeover speculation in recent months. But revelations this week about potential accounting errors and missing revenue and profit guidance targets caused some analysts to question their assessment. Hain s stock tumbled as much as 27.5% in premarket trading Tuesday morning, and a firm has now launched an investigation into potential claims on behalf of Hain shareholders.

Letting up on speculation of a Hain takeover may be premature based on the facts of the case, the value Hain s portfolio could provide and the list of hungry suitors that may be lining up.

In its announcement, Hain said that the company was primarily concerned about whether it accounted for the revenue associated with concessions made to some U.S. distributors in the correct time period. Those accounting errors are less likely to change total revenue for the year, but may have inflated profitability in certain quarters.

While investors may be concerned that Hain won t achieve its revenue and profit guidance for the year, the question is by how much. A dip in revenue would have to be fairly significant to drag Hain down to the slowing revenue growth or declines that many other major manufacturers including those that could potentially buy Hain recently reported.

Depending on how far off Hain s final numbers are, this plunge in stock price could make Hain more attractive to buy. An acquirer could offer either a lower bid or the same one, which would now carry a higher and more attractive multiple for Hain shareholders. The whole scenario could also pressure management to sell.

Hain Celestial has been a leader among larger natural food and beverage companies, having posted double-digit revenue growth for 20 consecutive quarters. Competition is heating up from retailers  better-for-you private-label brands, and larger manufacturers buying up or launching their own natural and organic food brands.

 That's putting pressure (and) a lot of squeeze on companies like Hain,  said Lou Biscotti, partner and head of the food and beverage practice at WeiserMazars.

In January, Hain lowered its expectations for fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings per share. In November 2015, it reported a 9% sales gain for fiscal Q1 2016, which ended its long streak of quarters with double-digit sales growth. That was followed by 8% growth for Q2, but Hain was back into double digits with 13% growth in Q3.

Speculation for a Hain takeover also sent the company s stock soaring as much as 12% on July 6, after Danone announced its $12.5 billion takeover bid for WhiteWave Foods, one of Hain s key competitors in the natural and organic space. Hain s shares had already increased 17% year to date at that time, though Hain still remains cheaper than WhiteWave, experts say.

 (Hain s) product line is very much in sync with consumer trends today,  said Biscotti.  And from what the experts talk about, their stock is a little undervalued, based on what happened with WhiteWave. (Hain) would be an excellent, excellent acquisition candidate. 

But who s buying? Several companies might, according to a wide range of speculation.

 General Mills is probably one that I would tip my hat to,  said Biscotti.

Food Dive named General Mills as the most likely candidate to acquire Hain in a recent story on M&A speculation. General Mills has proven its interest in better-for-you products in recent years, whether through acquisitions like Annie's, startup investments through its 301 Inc. platform. It's also done internal brand overhauls, like removing artificial ingredients from its cereals and revamping its yogurt portfolio.

With Hain as a leader in the natural and organic food and beverage space, its portfolio could fit well into General Mills  recently outlined plans for the future, which includes strategic investments in fast-growing brands and segments.

Kellogg has a portfolio and revenue growth needs similar to General Mills, which makes it another likely candidate to buy Hain. This could be for Kellogg what Annie s was for General Mills, and Hain could have synergies with Kashi.

Kellogg s overall portfolio is more concentrated than General Mills, primarily in cereal and snacks, while Hain extends further into grocery and even non-food brands. Hain s brands may be too far out of Kellogg s purview for it to consider an acquisition.

Kellogg has also been more focused on internal growth, with cost-cutting initiatives like Project K causing the company to shut down a number of facilities in recent years. However, Kellogg did launch its venture capital arm 1894 earlier this year, which could demonstrate the company s interest in future acquisitive growth. Kashi also acquired a vegan snack brand in July.

Danone may have ignited recent Hain takeover buzz with its own takeover bid for WhiteWave, but Biscotti said Danone shouldn t be ruled out as a contender to purchase Hain either.

""Danone just did this, and if it starts to go well for them, it would really be their first significant investment outside of their core, if you will,  said Biscotti.

WhiteWave isn t a done deal yet, and the acquisition has to prove itself after Danone integrates the brands into its portfolio. It s unclear whether Danone would be prepared to make another acquisition of a related but still very different set of brands in this space before proving to shareholders that growth in these categories is worth the purchase   or whether it would do so fast enough before another buyer swoops in.

Mondelez has proven it s willing to make the right acquisition moves based on its Enjoy Life Foods purchase last year, which positioned the company within better-for-you snacks and ingredients, and its rejected attempt to acquire Hershey earlier this summer. Last week, Mondelez announced it would acquire the license for Cadbury biscuits, so the capital and interest are there.

Hain would also fit well into Mondelez s growth strategy, which the company outlined last year and includes generating half of total revenue from better-for-you products in the next five years. Hershey has some better-for-you brands, like SoFit and Krave, but otherwise, like Cadbury, primarily aligns with sweets and indulgences. Hain would be a major step toward that healthy revenue goal.

But like Kellogg, Mondelez s portfolio is more focused on snacks than general grocery. The company even moved to divest its coffee business in a deal to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts last year, which could demonstrate that Mondelez may not be willing to go too far outside of its current set of product segments.

One potential acquirer of Hain receiving much speculation is Coca-Cola. But considering Coca-Cola s relatively focused portfolio and recent announcements, it s unclear whether that speculation will amount to anything.

Coca-Cola announced in March that the company was refining its business model to focus more on producing concentrate while getting rid of bottling and distribution. In that regard, a Hain acquisition doesn t seem to make sense, because Hain s portfolio includes both beverages and food.

Right now, adding food production, an area in which Coca-Cola is not experienced or potentially equipped, doesn t seem to make much sense.

Biscotti mentioned PepsiCo as a potential acquirer. Hain could bring more of a health focus to a beverages and snacks portfolio that, despite well-received developments like organic Tostitos and the announcement of organic Gatorade, still doesn t quite align with consumer health trends.

However, PepsiCo has been notably quiet in the M&A space for the past several years. PepsiCo saw major activity around the turn of the century, including acquiring Tropicana in 1998 and Quaker Oats (including Gatorade) in 2001. The company also initiated a handful of smaller acquisitions about a decade ago, including IZZE, Naked and Stacy s Pita Chip Co in 2006. But PepsiCo has since looked inward and focused on internal growth and returning capital to shareholders.

However, the beverage and snacks giant did seem to awaken when it offered to purchase a majority stake in Chobani last year, which Chobani rejected. That could signal PepsiCo s reenergized willingness to enter the M&A fray, as long as the product and price are right, and Hain could be a welcome addition to that portfolio.","F&B"
"What is 'natural'? Post lawsuits resurface debate."," Many manufacturers are avoiding use of the term altogether until the FDA determines its final defnition. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/what-is-natural-post-lawsuits-resurface-debate/424605/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 06:41:21 -0400","NA","What is 'natural'? Post lawsuits resurface debate.The term ""natural"" has been a focal point of litigation in recent years as consumers and public health advocates demand simple, clean ingredients lists and transparency in marketing claims, ingredients and processing. Manufacturers ranging from Dole to General Mills have faced these lawsuits, which have sometimes ended in settlements.

Any path to a definition for ""natural"" is likely to come with a struggle between the industry and consumers and public health advocates. The term ""organic"" saw a 10-year battle play out as the USDA sought to establish a finalized definition, and gluten-free received its official definition in 2013. But with the increasing amount of litigation surrounding ""natural,"" the FDA may be more keen to settle the issue so the courts can move forward with these lawsuits. Judges overseeing many of these cases have stayed them pending the FDA's decision.

Last November, the FDA opened a comment period to collect suggestions for what the term ""natural"" should mean from a scientific standpoint. Artificial ingredients, GMOs and herbicides have all been up for debate as to whether their usage should prevent manufacturers from making a ""natural"" claim about that product. The FDA closed the comment period in May but has yet to make any further announcement on future guidance for the term.

One option for manufacturers is to abandon the term altogether until the FDA sets a final definition as a way to avoid potential misinterpretation. Manufacturers are already doing this, with 22.1% of foods and 34% of beverages marketed as ""natural"" in 2013, compared to 30.4% and 45.5% respectively three years prior.","F&B"

The ketogenic diet also aligns with consumers' increased interest and consumption of healthy fats, such as the resurgence of full-fat dairy products. More recent research has questioned commonly held concerns about fats, particularly saturated fats, which have contributed to changing public opinion and decreasing demand for low-fat processed foods.

Like the gluten-free diet and its perceived benefits for health and weight loss, researchers question the viability of the keto diet for all people. Still, gluten-free product sales continue to rise, which demonstrates how niche diets can ultimately be sales drivers for manufacturers that can meet market demand.

Hain's stock soared after Danone announced it would acquire WhiteWave, a key competitor for Hain in the natural and organic space. Analysts believed Hain would be the next big purchase as the industry continues to consolidate.

Now some analysts are changing their stances and dropping their theses that Hain is still an acquisition target. While Hain's status is questionable, it could be premature to discredit Hain's potential takeover entirely. Before the board's audit committee completes its investigation, it's impossible to know just how much these accounting discrepancies could impact Hain's total revenue for the year.

Hain's revenue would have to fall significantly due for it to be on par with the declines other major manufacturers have reported recently. That includes manufacturers that could purchase Hain, such as General Mills, which reported a 6% decline in net sales for the past fiscal year.

Hain posted a 13% increase in fiscal third-quarter sales, returning to double-digit sales growth increases. Previously, two quarters with high single-digit sales increases had broken a 20-quarter streak of double-digit sales growth. Hain had already lowered its expectations for the fiscal year in January.

The company now has to sort out its financial reporting and any errors that could influence those revenue numbers. But whether those discrepancies will be enough to shake the confidence that Hain has a strong portfolio rooted in the fast-growing natural and organic sectors is less likely. It may take longer for a takeover to occur as the dust settles around this most recent announcement, but Hain is still positioned for growth in categories that align with consumers' preferences.

More manufacturers are introducing these pumpkin spice-flavored products because consumers keep buying them. Sales of pumpkin-flavored products increased 11.6% in the year leading up to July 2015, according to Nielsen.

General Mills announced earlier this year that it would debut a pumpkin spice variety of Cheerios for a limited time, which should hit stores this month. Cheerios remains the leading U.S. cereal brand, but sales have declined 18% since 2010. A new flavor could benefit the 75-year-old legacy brand, which saw a slower decline in sales last year after General Mills launched Cheerios with a gluten-free label.

But could a new flavor craze might arise this year that could threaten pumpkin spice's dominance?

Daily values are recommended levels of intake for each nutrient. It is the number that shows the daily requirement for each nutrient. Daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet. The daily value is used to calculate the percent daily value. The daily value is not seen on the Nutrition Facts Label, but is instead reported as a percent daily value.

Percent daily values are based on daily values and give a general idea of how nutrients in the food fit in the overall diet. Percent daily values allows consumers to easily calculate how much of each nutrient is required. The goal is to meet or not go above 100% of the DV for each nutrient per day(1).

Most of these changes have occurred because of the dietary related diseases that are common in the United States. Below are some of the nutrients that have daily value changes.

There are no longer International Units (IU) for vitamin A, D, and E. These will be replaced with mcg and mg. Institute of Medicine (IOM) Labeling Committee recommended this change in order to be consistent with the new Dietary Reference Intake reports. There is also strong scientific evidence that support these changes

The change in daily values and units might seem minor to the public, which is why it has gone unnoticed when the changes to the nutrition facts label were released. Most consumers will not even realize this minor change in numbers and units on the nutrition facts label. A major concern is that the change in daily values will affect the ability of the manufacturer to make nutrient claims. In order to be a considered  good source,  the product needs to contain 10-19 % DV of that nutrient. If a food is 5% or less of a nutrient, it is considered  low  in that nutrient.  And, if the food has 20% or more, the product it is considered  high  in that nutrient. Now that the daily values are changing, some products might not be eligible to be labeled a  good ,  low , or  high  source. When daily values increase, the percent daily value will decrease on the original product. And when daily values decrease, using sodium as an example, the claim for a product that is originally  low sodium  might not be considered  low  anymore. Companies will need to either remove the claim from their packaging or reformulate the product to appeal to the customers looking for a healthier choice. (4)

Education is key to inform consumers of these changes. Educational campaigns can help consumers better understand the changes to the nutrition facts label and how to use it to encourage overall health and make healthy choices while grocery shopping.","F&B"

But the complexity of meat color comes from a wide range of factors, including ""animal conditions such as age, nutrition and metabolic state; muscle type; presence of nitrogenous compounds, for example nitrate or nitrite; packaging environment; ingredients; and pH,"" Ron Jenkins, commercial development manager of meat, poultry and seafood at Innophos Inc., told Food Business News.

Manufacturers can turn to certain plant-based ingredients, such as rosemary, green tea, acerola cherry and plum extracts, to devise natural ways to preserve meat color and extend shelf life. These ingredients contain antioxidants and similar compounds that can prevent oxidative breakdown of meat pigments, but they can also affect meat's flavor.

Packaging innovations also present opportunities to preserve meat color and extend shelf life. Modified atmosphere packaging currently leads the global advanced packaging segment with more than 51% of market share.

Manufacturers experimenting with meat color may also consider ingredients and processes they use during processing, such as the phosphates they commonly use to improve juiciness, tenderness and cook yields. Phosphates can alter the color of fresh and cooked meats, particularly if the phosphate has a high pH level. If manufacturers are struggling with meat color, altering the use of these phosphates or finding replacements could be a solution.","F&B"

The research builds on the technical expertise CIGI has developed over the last ten years in collaboration with pulse growers and industry about the functionality and application of pulse flours.

 By working with Warburtons as a commercial partner on this project, there is a direct link to an end-customer.""

Saskatchewan Pulse Growers has offered $1.8m in funding for the project.

Warburtons is contributing $680,000 in support, in addition to funds to purchase a pilot-scale fermentation tank at GIGI, while the governments of Canada and Manitoba are investing $270,000 through the Grain Innovation Hub.

Western Grains Research Foundation and Manitoba Pulse & Soybean Growers have also provided funding of $158,000 and $25,000, respectively.

The three-year project aims to develop a pulse database summarising new and existing information on the compositional, functional and flavour properties of pulses for the food industry; and investigate the effects of pre-milling and post-milling treatments, particle size and storage.

The project also aims to investigate the use of pre-ferment processing on the functionality and end-product quality of doughs containing pulse flours, and explore the development of pulse-based bakery products that meet particular health and nutrition targets.

The new manufacturing unit expands Arla Foods Ingredients' capacity to meet the increasing demand for whey protein hydrolysate, an important ingredient in nutrition products specially meant for infants with allergies, as well as for clinical nutrition and sports nutrition products.

The new production plant was built beside the existing whey protein facility in Videb k, where the company built a new lactose factory. It triples the whey protein hydrolysates production capacity of Arla Foods Ingredients.

The factory produces 'gold standard' whey protein, which offers greater benefits compared with intact proteins.

Construction was completed by May 2016 and the new plant was opened in June 2016. The investment forms part of Arla Food Ingredients' strategic initiatives to strengthen its position as a worldwide leader in producing natural whey protein ingredients, while increasing the raw milk intake from its farmer owners.

The whey protein hydrolysates production facility adheres to the strictest quality and safety standards, and has a lesser environmental impact.

Arla Foods invested approximately $25m in 2013 to reduce the total CO emissions from its plants by 2%. The company has a climate strategy objective that aims to reduce the total CO emissions by 25% before 2020.

The company is also investing in 50 'Closer to Nature' projects, targeting cutbacks on energy and water consumption at its processing facilities.

Whey protein, usually concentrated in a powder form, consists of more than 76% protein and all the essential amino acids required for an infant's growth. Whey protein is also by athletes who want to take protein rich food while training and in competition.

The design agency based in the UK, rebranded and redesigned the popular Danish confectionary product for the first time in over 30 years back in January.

The Nordic confectioner has since seen the sales increase on standard packs of Skipper s Pipes liquorice pipes.

Having identified the product   which hadn t been significantly changed in decades   as being in real need of a refresh, the Manchester-based branch of the Danish agency then developed a whole new brand identity for Skipper s Pipes, which included packaging, tone of voice and other assets.

Agency Spring s UK Managing Director Paul Iddon said:  The pipes were already more popular than ever in Denmark, making a rebrand potentially risky.

 However, Cloetta seemed to recognise that while respect for the existing brand was important, so too was revitalising a product which had been largely untouched since the early 1980s. 

Since the release of the new standard sharing packs, advent calendar and log book, Agency Spring has designed gift and single serving variants for Cloetta, with a brand new product, named  XL , which is set for launch in September 2016.","F&B"

"Natural and clean label","Demand for clean label and natural products continues apace. In fact, fuelled by developments in communication and social media, the trend is extending to see natural equate to healthy as Beverage Innovation discovers.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/natural-and-clean-label/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 13:10:31 +0000","Beverage","Natural and clean labelThe following content originally appeared in issue 135 of Beverage Innovation, which you can subscribe to here.

Demand for clean label and natural products continues apace. In fact, fuelled by developments in communication and social media, the trend is extending to see natural equate to healthy as Beverage Innovation discovers.

In order to examine the clean label trend, colouring foodstuffs expert GNT conducted a comprehensive survey among 5,000 consumers in Europe, Asia and America. It discovered that people have an increasingly critical attitude towards additives as GNT head of group marketing Guido de Jager explains.

What is driving the trend towards clean label?

In spite of the fact that the term is not defined consistently, consumers consider clean labels to guarantee that food and beverages are free from artificial additives. They should offer short, understandable ingredient lists, which provide precise information about origin and use of the ingredients. Natural, familiar ingredients ensure a good feeling and have a positive influence on purchase decisions. They look for alternatives to colourants and E-numbers when shopping for groceries. More than two thirds thoroughly check ingredient lists, to make sure that products fulfil their expectations. 67% want easy to understand ingredient information.

The need for clear label solutions is also driven by regulations. Just recently the Gulf Cooperation Council, for example, published a legislation on the colours Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow, Azorubine and Tartrazine in order to dovetail better with international standards. All these underline the importance for manufacturers of taking clean label solutions into account.

How does this trend differ from country to country?

In Asia and South America, 60% of consumers are aware of healthy nutrition, but do not have time to investigate ingredients thoroughly. For more than half of the consumers in Europe and the US it s particularly important that food can be prepared quickly and conveniently. For both groups, easy to understand and transparent ingredient information is key.

How has consumer understanding of natural/clean label changed over recent years?

When people see the term  clean label , they expect natural food and beverages without any artificial additives. Our study reveals that 64% will put  natural  on the same level as  healthy . Consequently, products with natural ingredients are considered to be healthier than those with artificial additives. This trend has been increasing in recent years. Today s consumers are well informed. When it comes to food colours, they have a clear definition of  naturalness  in mind: nearly 50% expect natural food colourings to originate solely from edible raw materials such as fruit and vegetables.

Colouring Foods fully meet consumer demands and are ideally suited for the production of clean label beverages. They are exclusively made from fruit, vegetables and edible plants. On the packaging, they can therefore be declared as,  Colouring Food (concentrate of pumpkin, carrots) , for example. No solvents or chemicals are used. They are pure food   the epitome of clean label. Manufacturers can benefit from a clear communication of the use of truly natural colours: Credible claims like  coloured with fruit and vegetables  give producers the potential to increase brand preference even when a price increase is applied.","F&B"

As the priorities and palates of consumers evolve, businesses must ensure they keep ahead of the curve and develop alongside these trends, meeting ever-growing demand.

Consumer needs vary depending on region, age group, demographic and spending habits; however, you must also bear in mind the differences from country to country. As an international brand, we know all too well the fluctuations of ever-changing consumer behaviour and how, as a business, you need to keep on top of these in order to achieve success, both at home and further afield.

The UK food and drink industry is developing at a phenomenal rate   a rate that is continually driven by consumer trends and behaviour. Businesses need to capitalise upon this growth. At Mash Direct, we ve noticed a growing tendency of people wanting spicier flavours, something that we believe has, in part, developed through increased international travel. In response to this demand, we evolved the recipe for our Baby Bakes, our baby potatoes sprinkled with a crunchy crumb, enhancing them with spice as a result of consumers wanting hotter flavours. It has proved popular in both our home market as well as Dubai, and shows how jumping on the back of changing consumer tastes has been extremely fruitful for us, and can be for your business too.

It s definitely worth considering and we hope the following will help you to better understand your target market.

Research shows that consumer purchases can be divided into two categories: traditional, including convenience and taste attributes; and evolving, which include health and social responsibility characteristics. The importance of the heritage and provenance of products is rising and as a result, businesses are adapting their marketing strategy to tap into these opportunities. As people become more concerned with the produce they are buying, it leaves businesses in an even more competitive position.

For us, keeping up to date with the latest tastes and trends is key. Social media plays a growing part in this as it s a great way to see what people are engaging with, what the latest trends are and who s driving this change. This contributes and influences the direction our business takes and the products we create.

While food and drink trends are a common topic of everyday conversation, other sectors must also take a prominent interest in the direction their sector is taking. Trade exhibitions and consumer research are good places to begin, whether at home or abroad. After all, in order for a business to succeed, your main priority is appealing to your target market, therefore you need to get to know them personally.

The need to know your audience, and evolve with them, will ensure your business remains at the forefront. Enhancing growth through stronger customer engagement will all help you move in the right direction to maintain success, while solidifying customer confidence.","F&B"

Slowly increasing prices in the first half of the year have cost British households  1.4 billion   or almost  55 per household   compared to a year ago, with rising fuel costs being a big contributor.

But despite inflation, sustained cuts to supermarket prices are a sign of the continuing price wars between the UK s four major supermarkets, and discounters Aldi and Lidl. Prices have fallen by over 2.6% since the start of the year, and Asda s place as the cheapest supermarket reflects its sustained effort to undercut the discount retailers and remain the UK s cheapest supermarket.

The food and beverage sector provided  the largest downward pull  on prices in July, the Office for National Statistics said, though its contribution to the consumer price index over the last 12 months is slightly reduced from that of the year before.

Mark Billige of pricing specialist Simon-Kucher said:  We have now seen more than two years of falling year-on-year prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks, and this month was no exception, indicating the fierce supermarket price war still rages on. Since January prices have decreased by more than 2.6%, saving shoppers more than  50 per household compared with flat prices.

 Research by Which? showed that Asda led the price war this month by having the cheapest prices, which follows their indication last month that it will prioritise volume over profit. The hope for UK households will be that the supermarkets  battle to keep customers and protect market share will mean that they will be willing to swallow any future cost increases coming from rising post-Brexit import costs.

The 800kW biogas plant will go live in early 2017. In terms of the feedstock input, the operator, Incubadora Santander, which produces about 3.5 million eggs a day, plans to make use of the co-digestion of dry chicken manure from the laying hens and process water from the production.

The production yields a great amount of dry chicken manure and process water, with which the new plant from the German manufacturer can be operated without purchasing any additional substrate. The feedstock will be pre-treated in a sedimentation tank, where the manure will be separated from sand and lime and pumped into the 4,900m3 digester by way of an upstream storage unit with a capacity of more than 1,000m3. Through the co-digestion, the digestate will reach a high fertiliser value, enabling it to be returned into the plant s agricultural substance cycle for efficient use as liquid manure on its own fields.

Since the Colombian government started supporting the generation of renewable energies, the agricultural industry in particular has discovered huge biomass potential, Weltec Biopower said. In light of this, it said, Incubadora Santander has decided to generate energy from biomass. The enterprise, which operates several poultry farms in western Colombia, markets its eggs under the Kikes brand in 14 cities across the country.

Weltec s Juan Felipe Montoya Mu oz chose Weltec for the construction of the pre-storage tanks and digesters because of its German-made design, stainless steel body, high-quality materials and hygiene credentials, Weltec claimed.

Compact delivery and quick assembly are additional advantages of this material. Plant modules such as the ready-for-operation CHP plant, the preinstalled pump and control technology and the stainless steel panels for the tanks will be transported to the plant location in maritime containers from Germany, Weltec added.

The Weltec biogas plant will supply power and process heat from early 2017, supporting Incubadora Santander s expansion plans.

            

 According to a Weltec spokesperson, Incubadora Santander  was impressed with the high degree of international experience of Weltec Biopower.

 [We have] already demonstrated this experience through the establishment of large biomethane parks and biogas plants for various customers from the waste and food industries as well as from the agricultural and sewage treatment industries. Before making his decision, the Colombian operator toured various plant locations in Germany in order to see this for itself.

 With the help of such mature technology, the plans of the Colombian government are likely to succeed: to increase the share of renewable energies in the power network to 6.5% by 2020. Colombia s agricultural industry [in particular] is producing large quantities of side-products and waste that can be used for energy generation purposes. The country s energy potential for biomass is estimated at 16GWh a year. So far, these have been used almost exclusively for the production of biodiesel and ethanol, but this will doubtlessly change in the near future! ","F&B"

"Retail ready packaging offers advantages over traditional packaging"," 
	Demand for retail ready packaging is forecast to increase 5.2% annually to $6.2 billion in 2020, outpacing the overall packaging market average. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89048-retail-ready-packaging-offers-advantages-over-traditional-packaging","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Retail ready packaging offers advantages over traditional packagingDemand for retail ready packaging is forecast to increase 5.2% annually to $6.2 billion in 2020, outpacing the overall packaging market average. Retail ready packaging (RRP), also known as shelf ready packaging, display ready packaging, and pallet ready packaging, refers to secondary packaging for retail products that arrives in a manner enabling items to go directly onto the shelf or selling floor without the need for unpacking of inner contents.

RRP offers a number of advantages over traditional retail packaging in terms of labor costs, stock handling, and product visibility. Gains will be supported by further growth of mass retailers and club stores, and increased food and beverage sales volume in nontraditional outlets such as drug and dollar stores. Additionally, the proliferation of club stores and no-frills deep discount grocery stores will be especially important for RRP, as such stores primarily sell merchandise directly from secondary packaging and require their vendors to ship products in RRP, according to The Freedonia Group's (freedoniagroup.com) new study, Retail Ready Packaging.

Among major RRP product types, corrugated boxes, which represent more than 50 percent of total demand, will provide the strongest opportunities. According to analyst Esther Palevsky, ""Growth will be supported by expansion in the retail user base and the increased presence of value-added box types."" Gains for retail ready corrugated floor displays, folding cartons and reusable plastic containers (RPCs) will be more moderate than those for boxes, but will still be helped by overall retail trends promoting greater use of RRP.

Food is the predominant market for RRP, accounting for almost three-fourths of demand in 2015. Through 2020, growth in food uses will be fueled by labor cost savings resulting from reduction of product handling requirements during stocking. In addition, disruptive trends in the U.S. food retailing landscape will bode well for RRP. Among such trends is the increasing competition that traditional supermarkets face from a host of alternatives, including club stores, deep discounters, mass retailers, drug stores, farmers' markets, and e-commerce vendors. Increased openings of smaller-format locations by mass retailers will also promote gains for RRP, as these stores carry a more limited product selection than their traditional counterparts and have fewer employees. These stores can benefit from RRP's ability to speed stocking of shelves and increase shelf space efficiency.","Packaging"

 According to Excelsior Wines, U.S. importer for Frontera and parent company Concha y Toro, Chile s best-selling wine brand hopes to appeal to a new generation of wine lovers   21-34 year olds   with Frontera After Dark.

Starting this fall, consumers will notice striking changes to Frontera s 750-ml. range, including the addition of an  After Dark  tagline, a nod to the younger generation, for whom  The day starts to come alive at night!  Frontera Night Harvest Blends are a fresh winemaking concept: grapes harvested in the cool of the night for bolder flavors and aromas.

 

 Labels for Frontera After Dark 750-ml. bottles   the favored format of millennial wine lovers -- will now sport a dramatic black background, overlaid by a depiction of the Andes Mountains, traced in pale gold, making Frontera one of the first  dark-label  entries in the $4-7 value-wine sector. Dark labels represent a powerful new trend in the U.S. marketplace and dominate the landscape where millennials are concerned, as registered by an impressive +29% volume increase over traditional cream/white labels in 2015.

 

 Joining Frontera s After Dark 750-ml. line-up are two new blends: Moonlight White and After Midnight Red. Moonlight White is a semi-sweet style, faintly effervescent, fresh, light Moscato-based blend. After Midnight Red is a Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend, rounded out with a touch of Merlot.

 

 Frontera After Dark 750-ml. white varietals, including the new Moonlight White as well as the Pinot Noir will be sealed with a twist-off closure. Frontera  After Dark  750-ml. reds, including After Midnight Red, will remain under cork. Each Frontera After Dark label will retail for approx. $6.

 

 Support for Frontera After Dark will be provided via a 360 marketing campaign. At the  pre-tail  level, this includes geo-targeted social media ads and partnerships with the Ibotta in-store shopping app and online delivery services such as Drizly. Retail promotions include in-store radio ads, floor talkers and high-value discount bottle neckers, logoed wine racks, case cards, case sleeves and cold-box trays. A digital ad campaign, targeted at social media influencers and featuring wine cocktails and sangria recipes is also underway.

Frontera s classic 1.5-liter varietal range is also poised for a makeover, albeit of a more subtle nature. Launched in the U.S. in the early 1980s, Frontera s 1.5-liter format was an instant hit with baby boomers and today enjoys a multi-generational appeal. Starting in this summer, labels for Frontera s 1.5-liter wines will feature an enhanced image of the Andes Mountains juxtaposed against a cream background, to evoke a heightened sense of place and origin. A  ticket-stub  addition, with the varietal name positioned above a  Vineyards Protected by Nature  tagline, conveys a sense of journey, while referencing Chile s pristine natural environment, which offers exceptional conditions in which to nurture fine quality wines.","Packaging"

Along with that, a brand s commitment to sustainability and wellness is an increasingly competitive tool to drive consumer preference. As brands seek to tap into sustainability and wellness trends, brand owners can make significant strides in the arena with clean labels, transparency   both figuratively and literally   and by striving to reduce their carbon footprint throughout the supply chain.

In today s competitive market, communication is essential in order to establish consumer trust. To strengthen brand loyalty and attract consumers at point of sale, brand owners must speak to consumers through easy-to-read labels. Additionally, benefits such as sugar free, organic and non-GMO should be made very clear considering the increasing demand for wholesome products. As shoppers become more interested in knowing how products are manufactured, brands that effectively communicate sustainable business practices and how their ingredients are sourced help cultivate consumer trust.

The demand for nutritious products puts pressure on both brand owners and retailers   which makes communicating benefits more important than ever. For example, the national pharmacy CVS, rebranded to CVS Health in 2014, has seen increasing demand for more health-conscious food and beverage products. After a pilot program in 2015 in which the company offered healthier options in 500 stores throughout the nation, the chain is now expanding the initiative to 2,900 CVS pharmacy locations. The team at CVS also expects to occupy 25% of checkout space   traditionally reserved for products like candy and chocolate bars   with wellness products.

The trend for healthier products presents an excellent opportunity for food and beverage brands. When packaging reflects key benefits consumers are seeking, they can immediately connect with the brand and have a greater chance of choosing that product over an alternative.

A demonstrated concern for the environment is another aspect setting good and great brands apart. This applies to virtually every sector, including the beverage industry. Companies that position their brands as market leaders   and are planning to remain there for the long run   must be proactive in their sustainability efforts.

As part of the Bacardi Limited  Good Spirited: Building a Sustainable Future  environmental initiative, for example, the company promoted its 100% biomass-fueled distillery for its Tequila CAZADORES  in Mexico. Nothing goes to waste in the production process; organic materials, including fibers from the agave used to make the tequila, are converted to biofuel in order to power the distillery. As a result, the distillery reduced noise pollution by 20% and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by more than 80%.

In order to ensure consumer loyalty and longevity for a brand, a team must take the necessary steps to innovate and address challenges that come along with evolving trends. At PACK EXPO International, beverage brand owners will find the latest innovations that address wellness and sustainability. Attendees can expect to see materials that preserve freshness and reduce waste as well as labeling systems that provide greater sustainability and flexibility.

"DSCSA making progress, but toward what?"," 
	As mid-2016 passes by, the pharmaceutical packaging world is surrounded by serialization and DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) activity. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89041-dscsa-making-progress-but-toward-what","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","DSCSA making progress, but toward what?As mid-2016 passes by, the pharmaceutical packaging world is surrounded by serialization and DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) activity. As someone intimately involved in pharmaceutical packaging in practice and teaching, serialization is part of every single day.

At the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council (HCPC), we try to imagine how DSCSA might support safer packaging for consumers. The opportunities are numerous but for the moment everyone is focused on getting the job done. HCPC does note however, that this effort is mute the second we enter pharmacy and begin the antiquated process of repackaging prescriptions into little amber vials which truly unravels the potentially safe supply chain being sought by DSCSA. As well, the process contributes to poor health outcomes, through lack of reminder packaging, and unsafe products, due to exposure to moisture and oxygen post-pharmacy. (The HCPC study on post-pharmacy exposure is available at hcpconline.org.)

At Pester Pac Automation, I see case packer after case packer being readied for serialization as pharma manufacturers and contract packagers scramble to meet looming deadlines. The serialization providers and case packing methods are varied but the end result is the same. A simple process made overly complicated by a procedure which does not integrate well with automated case packing, i.e., line of sight barcode read and capture for bottles and cartons as they are collated and transferred to cases. Thanks to creative engineering, the challenge has been met but the process is less than elegant.

Before we were tasked with barcode serialization, RFID was the likely carrier for serial ID from about 2003 until around 2011. Around that time it was decided that RFID was not mature or robust enough for the task (It was also expensive). Many did not concur with that opinion but the money won the argument. I sincerely believe that those who killed RFID hoped that the complexity and cumbersome nature of line of sight barcode capture would kill any national pedigree legislation. Serialization was undesirable in any fashion; they gambled and they lost. Here we are, saddled with inserting this task into what were formerly efficient packaging processes. This task would have been dramatically less complex with RFID.

The spring of 2016 saw the inaugural graduate pharmaceutical packaging course at Rutgers University. We heard how students new to this world of pharmaceutical packaging would respond to the serialization task. Some were already engaged in the process as entry level employees at pharmaceutical manufacturers. Without exception, they wondered why  we  chose barcode over RFID or some other method that did not hinder the packaging process.

 We  went into the explanation and these grad students began to learn that it is not technology that rules the day, but politics. Even in the world of packaging, special interest groups and the power of politics trump technology. That is why we continue to repack in pharmacy; that is why we still have paper printed outserts; and that is why we are struggling to capture barcode reads instead of RFID. It was a valuable if not humbling lesson for the students, but it will make them better prepared to combat the objections they will encounter.

Better packaging solutions are out there; we need leaders who will look past the bottom line to engage them.

The Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council is a not-for-profit trade association whose mission is to promote the greater use of compliance-prompting packaging to improve patient adherence and patient outcomes, which will lead to reduced healthcare costs. The positive effects of this style of packaging have been proven by numerous studies over the past twenty years, yet U.S. pharmaceutical distribution still clings to an antiquated amber vial for a majority of prescriptions. While advances have been made in every facet of our daily lives, life-saving medication packaging remains in a vial introduced in the 1950s. The HCPC is working to change this.

"The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging line"," 
	When it came time to install a new packaging line, The Wine Group needed a solution that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89039-the-wine-group-incorporates-a-state-of-the-art-packaging-line","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging lineThe Wine Group (TWG) is one of the largest wine producers in the world, distributing more than 60 million cases of wine each year. From its corporate headquarters in Livermore, CA, the company ships out over five million cases of wine annually throughout North America, Western Europe and Asia. Satisfying the palates of wine lovers worldwide involves a sophisticated process. When it came time to install a new packaging line in the Livermore facility, TWG turned to its trusted partner for 15-plus years, Hartness International (hartness.com). With a shared commitment to excellence, Hartness has supplied accumulation and end-of-line packaging equipment in the past for TWG s Ripon and Livermore facilities.

 When we were putting in the new line in Livermore, we were looking for a line that was fully automated, could handle a variety of different sized packages and essentially  do it all ,  says TWG plant manager Ryan Dean.

From screw cap, cork, poly-laminated and PVC capsules, bulk glass and RSC glass, the line needed to handle a variety of customer demands. With the automated line, it was essential for TWG to increase accumulation capacity in order to minimize the effects of occasional micro-stops and downtime. Equally important was the ability for all of the equipment pieces to work together seamlessly.

A solution was needed that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. In the end, TWG opted to incorporate a DYNAC accumulation machine, case packer and laner from Hartness.

There were several components to this solution, but accumulation was the key. The Wine Group already had installed Hartness  DYNAC accumulation system and a top-load case packer and high-speed laner in other areas of its facility, and the company knew that these would integrate well together on the new line. DYNAC isolates the upstream and downstream operations by absorbing the changes in the line and providing a consistent metered flow of bottles.

On the TWG s line a new DYNAC 6900 was positioned between the filler/labeler and the laner/packer, allowing these machine centers to be close to each other, yet operate independently. The resulting DYNAC-centric design provided the desired smaller footprint and ample accumulation, and gave TWG the ability to work multiple line layout options to uncover the most productive design.

 These changes led to incredible advancements in efficiency for our line,  says Dean.

Since the installation of the DYNAC 6900, TWG has seen 10% efficiency gains on its most difficult molds. These gains drive dollar-for-dollar cases down by more than five cents each and represent 50,000 cases of incremental volume annually. As for material savings, Dean estimates that they have  approximately 95% less waste thanks to the DYNAC. 

As TWG does not run a traditional operator-at-each-machine scenario, the DYNAC accumulation provides enough uptime for plant operators to float on the floor where needed.

 We can run lean and prioritize where we are going to focus on the line because of the DYNAC. It provides about seven minutes of uptime when another piece of equipment is down, which gives our operators ample time to repair any issues on the line without interruption,  says Dean.

These time savings of minutes can also add up quickly and result in days of production time not lost over the course of a year.

The above savings could not be possible without proper communication between the equipment on the line and personnel involved.

 The Hartness DYNAC needed to communicate with our labeler and they were in sync when we needed them to be   as soon as we started them,  says Dean.

TWG turned to Hartness for additional secondary packaging solutions. Upstream, the DYNAC was communicating well with the labeler and earlier on with the filler. Downstream, the bottles still needed to be packed. TWG wanted to ensure that the chosen equipment would integrate with the rest of the line, as well as handle the variety of products to be packed on the line. The solution was a Hartness laner and case packer.

Hartness  Global Laner was selected for its high-speed capabilities as well as its smooth, servo-controlled operation and gentle handling of labeled bottles. With a changeover of less than 10 minutes, the laner is flexible enough to handle broad product sizes.

TWG also chose to install the Hartness 2800, a 40-cycles-per-minute servo-controlled case packer. One unique feature of the 2800 is its air transfer system, which eliminates line pressure as it captures the bottles and positions them above the grid for packing. Bottles are vertically loaded through plastic fingers that guide the bottles into the cases.

 What s nice about the Hartness Case Packer is that it can pack directly into a case with or without partitions, which gives us the ability of running two types of glass,  says Dean.

Ensuring successful product delivery, Hartness also provided the conveyor and control from the DYNAC to the packer resulting in a vertically integrated solution. Communication didn t stop at line integration. Training was also important to ensure success post-installation.

 Hartness trained the plant operators very well and worked with them at the pace they needed. Within a couple days, our team was able to pick up on how to operate the equipment properly and it s been working well ever since,  Dean explains.  Whether I needed parts or service performed, Hartness post-install was equally impressive in their customer service and response time. 

Since 1981, The Wine Group has delighted consumers around the world with unbeatable brand value and continuous innovation to consistently exceed their expectations. Having partners like Hartness ensures those values and beliefs are upheld at every stage of production.

 Hartness has been tried and true for us. Whenever we are looking at bottle handling or case handling equipment, Hartness is always at the top of the list based on the partnership that we ve built with them during the last 15-plus years at the Wine Group   and definitely at this facility over the past eight years,  says Dean.  I would say our new line is the most state-of-the art line in California today. ","Packaging"
"U.S. demand for caps & closures to approach $12 billion"," 
	Demand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high-value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). &nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89036-us-demand-for-caps-closures-to-approach-12-billion","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","U.S. demand for caps & closures to approach $12 billionDemand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). A mitigating factor for value growth will be continued lightweighting, which drives down the costs of raw material and keeps prices low. These and other trends are presented in Caps & Closures, a new study from The Freedonia Group (freedoniagroup.com), a Cleveland-based industry research firm.

Continued efforts to make foods and beverages more convenient to consume on the go, as well as to control portion sizes, will drive unit demand for caps and closures. Single serving beverage bottles are seeing greater use in fruit juices and drinks, flavored and enhanced waters, and other ready-to-drink beverages as consumers look for substitutes for carbonated soft drinks that can be easily transported and consumed while away from home.

According to analyst Katie Wieser,  Food producers are turning to rigid packaging for single serving snacks to make them less prone to crushing and easier to consume on the go. Both of these trends have bolstered gains for a variety of caps and closures, though plastic threaded caps, dispensing closures, and lids have seen the greatest impact.  These trends will continue to reach new markets and lead to the development of products with even greater levels of convenience, such as spouted pouches for a variety of drinkable foods.

Another factor that affects cap and closure demand is the continued shift from glass bottles and jars to plastic packaging formats. Innovations in hot-fill processing and barrier technologies have allowed plastic bottles and jars to gain significant share from glass alternatives. This has created good opportunities for plastic caps and closures, which will continue to hold the largest share of cap and closure demand and post healthy gains. Of all plastic closure types, dispensing and child-resistant closures will increase the fastest. Metal crowns and screw caps, on the other hand, will see only modest growth due to slow gains for beer production and the rising use of aluminum cans in the craft beer segment. However, metal roll-on caps will help to bolster gains somewhat as they see greater use for still wines and beverages packaged in aluminum bottles.","Packaging"
"The year of bio-based packaging"," 
	Bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89037-the-year-of-bio-based-packaging","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The year of bio-based packagingDerived from renewable materials such as wood fiber from trees or plastic from sugarcane, bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. Granting longer product life, sustainability and other benefits, it is met with enthusiasm from both packagers and consumers.

Though sometimes challenging to make the transition to bio-based substitutes, it would be a surprise to find a food or beverage supplier who hasn t at least tested it. Recent innovations are pushing the boundaries of sustainable packaging, and here are just a few solutions for consumers craving alternatives to traditional packaging.

Produce is one of the first food groups to lose its luster after only a few days in the refrigerator   or on a shelf. Strawberries are notorious for being finicky, waiting to adorn a special dessert or just to be popped into one s mouth.

Tufts University biomedical engineers may have the answer to the fast fruit-rot dilemma. Engineers found that fruits can stay fresh for more than a week without refrigeration if coated in an odorless, nearly invisible biocompatible silk solution. Fibroin, an insoluble protein found in silk, has the ability to stabilize and protect other materials while being fully biocompatible and biodegradable.

Fresh strawberries were dipped in a solution of 1% silk fibroin protein. After repeating the process, the coated fruit was treated with water vapor under vacuum (water annealed) to create varying percentages of crystalline beta-sheets in the coating.

The coated berries were stored at room temperature and dipped in varying numbers of coats of silk that had been annealed at different times and then compared with uncoated berries. Tests showed the silk coating prolonged freshness by slowing fruit respiration, extending fruit firmness and preventing decay.

A new 100% compostable wrapper by Sheffa Foods adorns its coffee house-inspired granola bars. Bio-based and renewable, the flexible package is designed to break down and fully return to nature, becoming part of the food waste stream.

Co-founder Leslie Angle believes that natural food products deserve natural food packaging. The new packaging material decomposes in controlled conditions in less than 180 days. If discarded in a landfill, it will break down like an orange peel and in a  reasonable amount  of time, compared to traditional plastic packaging that decomposes only after hundreds of years.

AIMPLAS (aimplas.net) has coordinated the research to develop new sustainable packages extending the shelf life of cheese and fresh pasta within the framework of the European project BIO4MAP. The result has been a new generation of barrier, multilayer and transparent packages with a 25% lower cost than conventional ones, lower environmental impact and lower carbon footprint by up to 29%.

The layers of bioplastics (PLA, PVOH and adhesives) and a wax coating obtained from olive leaves has made possible, insulating the product from oxygen and humidity in order to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi.

NatureWorks (natureworksllc.com) and Metalvuoto (metalvuoto.it) released a new line of high-barrier Ingeo-based flexible substrates designed to keep processed foods fresh on store shelves   specifically, for flexible packaging. Though used for years in fresh food packaging, this is the first application for longer shelf-life foods packaged in flat, stand up or square-bottom pouches.

The Metalvuoto film allows using a two-layer pouch with performance matching that of three-layer pouches. The Oxaqua coating technology claims to provide excellent barrier as well as heat seal-ability.

Although many brand owners are interested in reviewing their existing packaging to see how its environmental profile can be improved, there are several obstacles to taking it all the way to a bio-based material.

The biggest positive driver is the opportunity bio-based polymers present to brand owners to package products in materials that are as natural as the consumables they are protecting. With safety continuing to be a major consumer and governmental focal point, it is important to eliminate packaging components that might negatively impact the contents. Therefore, it s logical that the ideal goal would be to package food products in material that is derived from other food products.

While many are drawn to the perceived advantages, there are additional considerations that have to be part of the evaluation process. For example, bio-based materials do not lend themselves to the current recycling classification. A material such as PLA, which could be considered a PET substitute, cannot be recycled in the PET waste stream. Instead of the readily understood #1 designation, it would be labeled a #7, creating a potentially negative recycling scenario. Clearly, this is not desirable for brand owners.

The availability and economic viability of bio-based materials are also a significant consideration. Because the demand for these resins is relatively low, supplies are also low. Without volume to drive down cost, it is frequently cost-prohibitive to entertain conversion to these materials.","Packaging"
"New earth-friendly, reusable tin can for cannabis"," 
	Honest Marijuana Company packages cannabis in Earth-friendly, reusable tin cans that are brand-new to the industry.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89035-new-earth-friendly-reusable-tin-can-for-cannabis","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","New earth-friendly, reusable tin can for cannabisIn the marijuana marketplace, one company leads the sustainable cannabis cultivation forefront and is revolutionizing how cannabis is packaged and sold: Anthony Franciosi, founder of Honest Marijuana Company. Honest Marijuana Company packages cannabis in Earth-friendly, reusable tin cans that are brand-new to the industry. The cans keep the product extra fresh. And, they use all-natural growing methods to cultivate eco-conscious cannabis.

In contrast to the countless cannabis companies who package their product in disposable plastic containers, Honest Marijuana Company's cannabis is packaged and sold in recyclable tin cans with pure nitrogen to ensure only the highest level of integrity and quality. This environmentally sound packaging allows for the product to stay in its purest form and not be deteriorated by light or oxygen. Impermeable to oxygen and residual humidity, the tin cans are also inert to temperature fluctuations, meaning that they don't secrete any chemical compounds that will kill the fresh aroma of the cannabis terpenes. The cans preserve the cannabis flowers for years! With this revolutionary new packaging, Anthony hopes to inspire other cannabis companies to place a greater focus on sustainability and caring for Mother Earth.

Anthony Franciosi, founder of Honest Marijuana Company, started growing strains as a healthier way to relieve the pain from years of sports injuries, rather than ingest and possibly get addicted to pain killers. Using organic nutrients like kelp and fish food, the company's plants work symbiotically with the natural nutrients in the soil, so the plant reaches out and draws from the soil precisely what it needs, primarily iron and copper.

 After working in landscaping for many years, I decided to turn my passion for green living, all-natural marijuana cultivation, and holistic pain relief into a full-time career... I grew in a small facility focused on pesticide-free, organic methods, which I believe is the only option for connoisseur quality,  says Franciosi.

Through a ""top feeding"" method, Honest Marijuana Company ensures that 5% or less water is wasted in their facility. Their top-of-the-line sediment filter keeps sediment, chlorine and other harmful elements out of their water supply and out of the town's sewage system. The water chilled climate control system uses 30% less electricity than a standard HVAC system, and it also grabs wasted power and feeds it back into the system to be reused, resulting an additional 10% energy savings. When the external ambient temperature is below 45 degrees, their system is able to utilize the outside air and convert it into another 60-70% energy savings.","Packaging"
"Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger filler"," 
	Many of today's newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88996-integrating-a-form-fill-seal-bag-machine-with-an-auger-filler","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger fillerNew designs in food packaging are constantly being developed and introduced to consumers. While these new trends are sharp and eye-catching, product nevertheless needs to get inside   and that can be tricky at times with smaller openings and different packaging sizes.

Many of these newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. For food manufacturers and packagers, these machines are a major purchase that can take months to accurately specify, quote, build and deliver. The process can become easier by improving communication between the vendors and customer early in the design stages. This will make that process a much quicker and smoother experience for everyone involved   and deliver an FFS machine that s ready for action the first day it s installed.

One of the main components of the design process is the integration of the VFFS machine to an auger filler. These two pieces of equipment need to be in-sync with one another to properly deliver the desired performance for the customer s application.

To get started, the vendors and customer need to share basic information with each other including:

Knowing this information upfront helps vendors determine the scope of the project. It also allows the auger filler supplier to determine if the customer s desired performance specifications for the application can be achieved.

The reason to have answers to these questions in the early stages is that each one influences the other; if one of the answers to a question is unknown, it can change the scope of the project.

The size and shape of the forming tube is one of the most important pieces of information a filler vendor needs in designing a system to integrate with an FFS machine. The amount and speed of which the product can be filled depends largely on the diameter of the auger, and that is dictated by the diameter and shape of the forming tube.

Simple physics comes into play in determining the fill rate. Obviously the larger the forming tube, the more product that can be dispensed in a single auger revolution. For example, an auger that is 2   inches in diameter delivers 12.27 cubic inches of product per revolution, whereas an auger that s just a half inch larger in diameter delivers 24.74 cubic inches of product per revolution  twice as much. The size of the forming tube is of great interest to the filling machine vendor because the company wants to know how much space it has to work with inside that tube. Knowing this up front allows the supplier to determine if the specified speed can be met for the designed pouch size. If it does not, either the bag needs to be redesigned to a larger size or speed requirements must be reduced.

It is also important to review the flow characteristics for each product to be filled. In general, products are free flow or non-free flow, and each requires a different tooling setup. In some cases products can be a little of both, and the result is anything from an occasional drip to a steady stream of product flowing after the auger has completed its cycle. This may require a tooling set up that calls for a clam shell cut-off, a cone cut-off, or possibly the latest technology: vacuum cut-off. All three of these special tooling setups take up additional room in the form tube, causing the size of the auger and therefore, the output speed, to be reduced.

Dust removal is an area that also needs to be factored into the integration of the VFFS machine with the filling machine. Since the pouch is sealed on three sides, any dust from the fill will escape going up. If the application calls for dust collection, then dust collection is required to capture it, and it needs to be located within the forming tube   and that takes up valuable space.

Electrical specifications of each system are another area to consider. Often the end user will have an electrical specification that must be met. The filler supplier needs to know this upfront when quoting the project. There is also the possibility of the VFFS supplier and the filler supplier to share components. A good example of this would be to integrate control screens on a common HMI (human machine interface), thus giving the end user single-point control for the complete system. To do that effectively, it s best to approach this objective early on.

One final point on machine integration: Discuss the factory acceptance test up front during the quoting process. Will there be a test at the filler company, the bagger company or both? What are the criteria for these tests? Will the VFFS company require technical assistance from the filler supplier for the test? What are the criteria for the start, installation and training at the customer s plant? Technical assistance requirements should be defined and planned for in advance.

Bringing in all vendors together with the customer to discuss performance goals and share information early on in the design process will help streamline the integration between the FFS machine and filling machine. Vendors have expertise in their specific areas, and sharing information ensures all aspects of the integration will move along in a smooth and efficient manner.

"From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industry"," 
	The plastics industry in ASEAN remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89034-from-challenges-to-opportunities-favorable-climate-for-the-plastics-industry","Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industryThe plastics industry in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nation) remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries. With K 2016, the world s largest trade fair for plastics and rubber, coming up in D sseldorf, Germany (October 19-26, 2016), here is a closer look at this market.

The new norm of economic growths and trends such as oil prices, variable supply and demand, and weakening of most Asian currencies against the US dollar, have allowed the region s countries to rediscover their strengths to sustain growth either individually or as a part of the collective grouping of the 10-member ASEAN, which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.

ASEAN s fertile consumer base with a combined population of over 600 million and a combined GDP of US$ 2.6 trillion, as well as presence in the global market, enables the region to tap the right opportunities, hinging on the region s rising middle class sector.

One of ASEAN s top export sectors by value is plastics and plastic products earning US$ 39.3 billion in export revenues in 2013.

The sector s production rates have witnessed a steady average growth over the recent years, especially in the ASEAN-6: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, which account for more than 95 % of regional GDP, according to McKinsey & Company.

Vietnam s relatively promising plastics industry had an average annual growth of 16-18 % between 2010 and 2015. Packaging accounts for 37.4 %, followed by consumer goods (27 %), construction (18 %) and technical products (15 %). Yet, the industry is still at the  low end and of low value , according to Vietnam Plastics Association (VPA), with a majority of exports being plastic bags to Japan. It also relies heavily on imported raw materials, like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) resins, importing an average of 4 million tons of raw materials while domestic production totals 1 million tons.

Meanwhile, with a population of over 250 million, Indonesia s government has increased efforts to industrialize and develop the nation towards becoming the world s seventh largest economy by 2030. Its rising middle class, expected to double to 141 million people within the next five years, will drive plastics consumption. According to the Indonesian Packaging Association, food packaging accounts for 70 % of plastic consumption sales. The Aromatic, Olefin and Plastic Industry Association (Inaplas) has set a 6 % growth in domestic demand for the plastics sector, sustained by an improving GDP of 5.3 % in 2016 and upbeat food and beverage and agribusiness sectors.

One of ASEAN s top exporters of plastic products, Malaysia has more than 1,500 plastic production companies that export to Europe, China, Singapore, Japanand Thailand. The packaging sector accounts for 45 % of the total plastic consumption market, followed by electronics (26 %), automotive (10 %) and construction industry (8 %). However, due to a rise in Malaysia s minimum wage to US$ 214 per month, plastic production costs have increased within the country by approximately 10 % over the course of 2015.

Thailand s plastic consumption is led by packaging (48 %), electronics (15 %), construction (14 %), and automotive (8 %). Its automotive sector attracts manufacturing opportunities, although its overall cost index (for example, energy, labor, and property) is 20 to 25 % higher than Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, largely because of a high quality and mature automotive manufacturing ecosystem, including tiered suppliers of automotive components. The country has also invested US$ 60 million into bioplastics development over the past seven years, with the government supplying 80 % of this investment.

Export-oriented Philippines has witnessed weak exports performance, down by 5.8 % in the previous year, because of low demand from its top buyers: the US, China and Japan. The semiconductor and electronics industries account for the majority of the country s exports. Various measures are being instituted to boost exports, such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) of the European Union (EU) that is offering export opportunities to the Philippines by allowing less or no duties on exports to the EU.

Meanwhile, global chemicals hub Singapore, which has been voted the world s most expensive city for expatriates for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), offsets its high costs by offering strong connectivity through shipping routes, a developed infrastructure, manpower capabilities and ease of doing business.

Around 95 companies are represented on Singapore s Jurong Island, attracting investments in excess of S $35 billion, according to the Economic Development Board. Providing a plug-and-play environment, the island allows companies to quickly ramp up their operations, helping growth in both upstream and downstream sectors. Presently, companies like BASF, ExxonMobil Chemical, Lanxess, Mitsui Chemicals, Shell and Sumitomo Chemicals have plants. However, BMI Research expects Singapore to face an uphill climb in 2016, in the face of a Chinese downturn and regional oversupply. Thus, the country is counting on the specialty chemical sector as the next growth area, according to the Economic Survey of Singapore by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).

Pushing the region s plastics industry further, initiatives are being laid out by plastics trade associations, including the ASEAN Federation of Plastics Industries (AFPI), the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA), the Thai Plastic industries Association (TPIA), and the Philippines Plastics Industry Association (PPIA). The associations are working together with international-scale trade agreement blocs, including the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), and the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The AEC, which went into effect on January 1, includes liberalization of goods, investments and services and will enable plastic producing countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore to lower duties on finished plastic products, machines and molds to other member countries like Vietnam, which buys about 80 % of its plastic materials requirements from Thailand and Malaysia.

Indonesia also imports more than 40% of its plastics requirements from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Europe and the US.

The US-led 12-nation TPPA will liberalize trade regulations between the member countries and also eliminate tariffs as high as 25%. The easier access to overseas markets also has benefits for the countries.

The RCEP, made up of ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, aims to consolidate the existing ASEAN FTAs and alliance with the other six partner economies. It will impose a 65 % tariff cut, with the percentage likely to increase to 80 % within a decade. The RCEP could also usher into the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) s long-time prospect of creating a Free Trade Area in the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).

With these optimistic developments, the ASEAN plastics industry will witness an expansion. In the ASEAN Business Outlook Survey 2014, by the American Chamber of Commerce Singapore and US Chamber of Commerce, Indonesia ranked as the most attractive country for new business expansion, followed by Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. Availability of low-cost labor in countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, renders a competitive advantage. Overall, ASEAN s growing consumer bases, broadening of plastic import and export markets, and expanding foreign trading powers offers foreign investors significant opportunities.

"P28 revives packaging with a little help"," 
	The P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89032-p28-revives-packaging-with-a-little-help","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","P28 revives packaging with a little helpThe P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion. TricorBraun (tricorbraun.com) was commissioned and created a true game changer for the high-protein spread.

The company was launched by three brothers in the baking business who decided they needed to get in shape and lose weight. Initially, they turned to an exercise and nutrition program; but when that didn't produce the results they were looking for, they turned to their personal trainer who was also a nutritionist. The brothers plus one joined forces and in 2008, they introduced a bread and the original-high protein spread.

Originally, the high-protein spread was packaged in a 'peanut butter style' jar and wasn't well differentiated nor was it disruptive on shelf. According to Jeff Prince, director of operations at P28,  We wanted to get away from being just another typical spread jar on the shelf. With P28, we are always looking to change the game. We're always looking to be original and offer our customers high quality, innovative products. We wanted that same idea to hold true in our packaging. 

Prince goes on to say,  We chose TricorBraun because of their game changing design capabilities, the quality of their work and their top notch communication.  The process at TricorBraun began with the discovery phase. This allowed the team to clearly comprehend, define and help P28 realize their vision. Many things were taken into consideration including brand, competitive landscape, technical restraints and success criteria.

It was clear that the package needed to be a PET 16 oz. jar and that there were seven SKUs but according to Prince,  We were searching for something unique, exciting and high quality that screamed pick me up! If the consumer picked up the jar just to feel the difference in the structure, we knew this would ultimately lead them to reading about our product and its benefits. 

According to Samantha Juna, package design manager, TricorBraun,  We looked at a variety of shapes, closures and different deco methods including labeling vs. shrink sleeving the bottle; but the big turning point came when we agreed to play up the sports angle and truly differentiate from a regular peanut butter. We explored surface changes, more pronounced textures and athletic silhouettes. We took inspiration from some of the sports drinks on the market.  She explains further,  We essentially left the peanut butter category and went to nutraceutical. 

About the time of reaching design freeze, TricorBraun's graphic design manager Molly Fuehrmeyer was revamping the current graphics and applying them to the structure for visualization.  The goal was to highlight the attributes of the shape of the bottle and we were confident that a shrink sleeve would be the best deco method to capture the vignette on the arch,  she explains.

Fuehrmeyer adds,  The first approach was to take the original artwork and conservatively make it work with the new structure but P28 felt that a more playful look was needed while retaining the established SKU colors and the logo positioning.  The final artwork includes opaque areas where the text is clearly readable. This leads to a vignette that accentuates the shape and then a clear arch that reveals how much product is left. It was important for the flavors: almond butter, signature blend, white chocolate, banana raisin, caramel turtle, peanut butter and apple crisp to be very visible on shelf.

After a year in the making, the product was launched in the summer of 2015 and in 2016, the package design recently won the PAC  Global Leadership Award: Silver in the Food & Beverage Brand Revitalization category.

TricorBraun orchestrated the process with multiple outside suppliers. The bottle is manufactured by Pretium, the stock closure is from PANO and the shrink sleeve is done by Metro Label. The bottles are filled by P28 and can be found in retail in the US at all Vitamin Shoppe locations, 800+ Wal-Mart locations, all Wegmans and thousands of others. In Canada, the product can be found at Popeye's and online at SupplementSource.ca and SupplementsCanada.com.

The IMDA is an association of injection molders, printers and suppliers of materials and machines used for in-mold decorating. In the 10th edition of the awards this year, market leader Verstraete IML from Maldegem won awards in the following categories: Best Thin Wall Packaging, Best Blow Molded Package and Best Product Family. As a result, Verstraete IML took home three of the eight awards.

IMDA Symposium sets the tone

 In early June, Verstraete IML received the IMDA awards during the 2016 IMDA Symposium at the Franklin Marriott Cool Springs hotel in Tennessee. Peter Paelinck, business development manager North America, states,  The IMDA Symposium is an annual event which is eagerly anticipated by every company in the IML packaging industry. It is the perfect place to brush up on your skills in the area of in-mould labelling (IML) and in-mould decorating (IMD). What's more, you can attend interesting workshops and get an opportunity to network with IML specialists from around the world. Verstraete IML is very honoured to receive three awards on this occasion. 

Best Thin Wall Packaging - Gold for Unilever

 Unilever's margarine containers and lids underwent a thorough makeover. They are now made with paper-thin walls which meet the most stringent technical requirements. Unilever switched from direct printing to in-mould labelling. And they changed the shape of the containers - from round to rectangular - to save valuable space during transportation and on shop shelves. Thanks to the photographic quality of the IML labels and the seven different sizes, the four brands now occupy a unique market position. In addition, the re-branding of Unilever's margarine brands proceeded smoothly due to the excellent cooperation between Verstraete IML and the three injection moulders RPC BRAMLAGE-Wiko USA, PSPM and Berry Plastics.

Best Blow Moulded Package - Gold for Taanayel

 The Lebanese dairy giant Taanayel Les Fermes, known for its natural, authentic and traditional dairy products, exchanged its glass Balan Baladi packaging for blow moulding using IML. The vintage design of the packaging enhances the authentic nature of the product. IML for blow moulding is the perfect packaging technology for dairy products. The IML labels from Verstraete IML are moisture-proof and can withstand temperature fluctuations. This makes them an ideal solution for decorating synthetic packaging for refrigerated products.

Best Product Family - Silver for Berry Plastics

 Berry Plastics  SelecTE  product group is a range of high-quality rectangular, sealed packaging provided with three-sided or five-sided IML labels. Thanks to the way in which this packaging is decorated, the quality of the food product is clearly visible to the consumer through the transparent sections of the packaging and there is also enough free space to attract consumers with the excellent graphical quality of the label. The entire packaging is 100% recyclable. The container, the lid and the label are all made of polypropylene. The IML label can also be printed on transparent material or in a metallic look to draw greater attention to the brand on the shop shelves.

Supplier of IML labels and professional expertise

 Verstraete In-Mould Labels has more than 25 years of experience in offset printing labels on polypropylene for injection moulding, blow moulding and thermoforming. The company produces more than 45 million in-mould labels every day for various segments of the packaging industry.

"Sagamore Spirit introduces new premium straight rye whiskey"," 
	Sagamore Spirit is marking a new entry into the American whiskey marketplace with the introduction of its premium Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Whiskey. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89027-sagamore-spirit-introduces-new-premium-straight-rye-whiskey","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Sagamore Spirit introduces new premium straight rye whiskeySagamore Spirit is marking a new entry into the American whiskey marketplace with the introduction of its premium Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Whiskey in three major markets in the United States Maryland, Washington, DC and Delaware with New York to follow shortly.

 Maryland has a deep history and heritage with distilling rye whiskey that dates back to before Prohibition,  says Brian Treacy, president of Sagamore Spirit.  Maryland was home to more than 40 distilleries and we honor that tradition by making a spirit worthy of our state s distilling heritage. 

To help create an innovative and beautiful package which would adhere closely to the new premium spirit s quality taste and smooth finish, it called upon Saxco International LLC (saxco.com) of Horsham, PA, world-wide packaging specialists for the wine, spirits, beer and food industries and its vast global resource network to assist.  Our role was to help create an attractive and colorful new package that would also deliver a prominent and distinctive shelf presence and bring the project to a successful conclusion,  states Beth-Anne Kline, regional sales manager for Saxco International, who coordinated on the project with Saxco s Eric Guli, supply chain project manager.

Working closely with Sagamore s brand management team, along with creative collaboration between Sagamore Creative, of Baltimore, MD and Ptarmak, of Austin, TX, Saxco helped create a high-quality custom mold. The mold included a diamond shaped 750ml flint bottle with flat shoulders and embossed logos on the front, back and heavy glass bottom. Saxco then provided a reliable, time-tested overseas source to produce the bottle which incorporates embossed 1909 logos on the front and back and a three diamond logo on the bottom. The 1909 logo signifies the year the Sagamore Farm Springhouse was built, where Sagamore Spirit draws water to cut their rye whiskey to 83-proof.  The farm is built on a shelf of limestone rock and limestone water makes for some of the best rye whiskey you can have,  explains Treacy.

Saxco also supplied a rich looking custom black wood top natural cork assembly for the bottle s closure from a longtime quality supply source in Portugal. The wood top has a three diamond logo imprinted on the top. The closure was over fitted with a burgundy and black capsule from one of Saxco s long time trusted suppliers in California.

 

 The tricolor pressure sensitive labels were completed by a Sagamore Spirit source and hand applied to each bottle. Every bottle is hand labeled with a batch number, bottler number and signed by the bottler.

Sagamore Straight Rye Whiskey is 83-proof and 41.5 percent alcohol by volume and is being bottled in Baltimore, Maryland. The distilling team blends two different mash bills, a high rye and a low rye and then adds the Sagamore Farm spring-fed water to cut the whiskey to proof.","Packaging"
"Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020"," 
	Emergence of sustainable materials will accelerate the growth of ampoules packaging through 2020.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89023-global-ampoules-packaging-market-to-grow-through-2020","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020According to the latest research report released by Technavio, the global ampoules packaging market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% until 2020.

  Increased environmental concerns among consumers have increased the demand for sustainable packaging materials, thereby influencing the ampoule packaging market. Ampoules are made of conventional plastics, which do not decompose easily. Vendors are adopting sustainable materials to reduce the dependency on conventional plastics and adopt eco-friendly practices. The emergence of green plastics or biodegradable plastics will fuel the growth of the market during the forecast period,  says Sharan Raj, a lead industry analysts for packaging at Technavio.



  These plastics made from petrochemicals and contain biodegradable additives. They can be easily decomposed by microorganisms and produce less toxic gasses compared to conventional plastics. Increased use of materials, including polyvinyl alcohol, polyanhydrides and polylactic acid by plastic packaging manufacturers will reduce the market share of conventional plastics. Vendors in ampoules packaging are increasingly using biodegradable plastics to comply with stringent environmental regulations,  says Sharan.

Some of the other driving forces behind the growth of the global ampoules packaging market are as follows:

Increased prevalence of chronic diseases and infections

 Increased prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., cancer and tuberculosis) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) serves the ampoules packaging market as a driver. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 592 million by 2035.

In addition, the number of patients with infectious respiratory, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted diseases (HIV infection and AIDS) as well as hospital-acquired infections (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) has also increased.

Rising number of chronic diseases are increasing the demand for vaccines and anti-thrombotic drugs in the market. Owing to these developments, the global market for antithrombotic drugs is projected to reach U.S. $21.6 billion by the end of 2018. Thus, the increased prevalence, early diagnosis and regular monitoring of chronic diseases is likely to increase the demand for ampoules packaging during the forecast period.

Strict government regulations and standards

 Strict government regulations and industry standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products have resulted in a positive impact on the market. According to FDA regulations in the U.S., pharmaceutical solutions or drugs need high barrier packaging materials and sealants that are impermeable and resistant to solvents, grease, chemicals, and heat. Government regulations in developed countries such as Japan and European countries demand greater barrier and security protection of medical supplies and devices. In addition, for the supply medical products produced nationally to the domestic and international markets, governments in developing countries such as China and India have upgraded their industry standards for ampoule packaging to maintain quality, safety, and reduce breakage, spillage, and contamination. Thus, strict regulations and standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products are expected to fuel the growth of the ampoules packaging market until 2020.



 Significant growth in emerging countries

 The global ampoules product manufacturers are focusing on emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) to expand their operations. The governments are taking initiatives to build healthcare infrastructures and increase healthcare budgets. They are also focusing on the improvement of diagnostic procedures. Due to air pollution and water contamination, there has been an increase in the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases. BRIC countries represent an attractive market for multi-national corporations in the healthcare industry owing to the rising awareness among consumers about chronic and infectious diseases. For instance, in 2011, Russian manufacturing, packaging, and R&D division received an assurance from the Association of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers to invest a minimum amount of $1 billion. Novartis is also investing $500 million by 2016. In addition, Novo Nordisk, Nycomed, and Sanofi have also expanded their businesses in Russia. Other pharmaceutical companies like Roche have partnered with local pharmaceutical companies under out-licensing agreements. All these factors will fuel the global ampoules packaging market in the forecast period.","Packaging"

"Popularity of organic baby food to push growth of market"," 
	The growing popularity of organic baby food will aid in the growth of the global baby food, infant formula market through 2020, reports Technavio. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89020-popularity-of-organic-baby-food-to-push-growth-of-market","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Popularity of organic baby food to push growth of marketThe growing popularity of organic baby food will aid in the growth of the global baby food, infant formula market through 2020, reports Technavio (technavio.com).

Technavio s latest report on the global baby food and infant formula market provides an analysis on the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2016-2020. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline.

The top four emerging trends driving the global baby food and infant formula market according to Technavio food and beverageresearch analysts are:

Packaging and innovation

 In terms of packaging, products in glass or tubs contribute to the majority of baby food sales. However, fast growth is experienced by pouches, i.e., containers with plastic spouts on the top from which food can be sipped. The popularity of pouches is mainly attributed to their ease and flexibility. Baby food pouches are convenient and portable nutrition, as they are extremely compatible with consumers' on-the-go lifestyles and significantly promotes independent feeding.

 Baby food pouches act as food-grade barrier film that aids in keeping the content inside the pouch fresh for longer. In addition, parents feed their baby in small portions and seal the food back in the pouch for later use. Baby food pouch storage is convenient in comparison to box and glass counterparts, as pouches do not occupy much space in diaper bags or the home pantry.

Growing popularity of organic baby food

 With environmental conditions deteriorating globally, there is a rising anxiety as to the safety of the products we use and, even more so, the food we consume.  A growing trend towards organic products is witnessed, which stems from a concern for our health and general wellbeing and, even more so, that of our children. Organic baby products, food in particular, have therefore garnered much attention in recent years,  says Vijay Sarathi, a lead analyst at Technavio for food research.

Organic baby food products are in demand due to its many benefits. It contains no chemicals, pesticides, preservatives, hormones, or antibiotics. Many stipulations govern the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of organic baby food. All the cereals must be grown without using chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Dairy and poultry products are derived from livestock, which are fed organic feed and not administered growth hormones. The foods, once prepared, contain no preservatives, artificial flavors or colors, or other additives.

Expansion of product portfolios by vendors

 Consumers increasingly demand varied options in terms of blends and flavors to cater to their babies  nutritional requirement. Leading baby food manufacturers continually update their product lines to include new and unique products that set them apart from the competition. In July 2013, Plum Organics launched a toddler snack range, Mighty 4, a range of blended organic fruits, vegetables and grains.

Furthermore, it is believed that offering different variants and flavors of vegetables, fruits, and cereals will help develop the food habits of babies as they grow. In addition, companies are continuously developing their products to improve them, as parents prefer to give healthy and tasty food to their babies. Abbott launched non-GMO infant formula Similac in the US in 2015. In addition, it contains OptiGRO, which significantly helps in the development of babies' brains and eyes. It also launched products in the China, India, and Europe nutrition markets. Therefore, the extension of product portfolios by vendors is another driver that is propelling the growth of the market.

Increase in online purchasing

 E-commerce retailers are competing with physical stores in terms of convenience and price, as the online platform reduces and eliminates physical infrastructure. In addition, online platform, in some cases, eliminates links in supply chain, helping them to provide products at a reduced cost. The online platform offers busy parents of compelling proposition of shopping whenever and wherever possible. Approximately 18% of parents have brought baby food online in 2015.

  Around one-third of people in APAC have ordered baby food through the online platform. Hong Kong and South Korea are the key leading regions in terms of purchasing baby food and infant formula through the online platform,  says Vijay.","Packaging"

The products are sold in combiblocCompact with screw cap combiSmart from SIG Combibloc (sig.biz). With this product launch, Alpura and SIG Combibloc are kicking off their partnership with an innovative product, as evaporated milk in carton packs with a screw cap is a newcomer to the Mexican market and offers a new solution for retail.

Founded in Mexico in 1972, Alpura is now the country s second-largest dairy company, with around 6,000 employees and a further 7,000 indirect contributors (farm workers and suppliers). More than 123 farms are part of the company. Each day, these farms produce an average of 2.9 million liters of milk, which is then processed at the cooperative s two production plants in Cuautitl n Izcalli (Mexico) and Ciudad Delicias (Chihuahua). The company s product range includes more than 87 products from the segments milk, yogurt, cream, cheese, butter and desserts.

Alpura is now expanding its product portfolio with the addition of evaporated milk, and has opted for filling technology from SIG Combibloc to fill the products. A CFA 612 filling machine to fill products in aseptic carton packs combiblocCompact has been installed. This filling machine can fill a total of seven different volume sizes. The Alpura evaporated milk carton packs are fitted with the reclosable screw cap combiSmart.

 Evaporated milk in carton packs with screw cap is an innovation for the Mexican market. Previously, evaporated milk was mainly available here in food metal cans. For serving, people then usually put the products into a small pot or jug. But those days are over. With the screw cap, the milk can be neatly poured and conveniently portioned out directly from the carton pack. After use, the carton pack can be reclosed, so the product remains protected even after it s been opened for the first time. This is extremely convenient for consumers. We re very proud that we ve marked the beginning of our partnership with Alpura with an innovation,"" says Antonio Fiumara, head of sales in Mexico at SIG Combibloc.

Jorge Aguilar, CEO of Alpura adds,  We are confident that with evaporated milk in reclosable carton packs, we re offering consumers real added value. With the convenient, easy-open closure, the package fits perfectly with the convenience trend that modern consumers demand. The carton pack is very easy to open and conveniently reclose, because combiSmart has little  wings  on the sides of the screw cap.  The closure is applied to the closed and sealed carton pack by an applicator after the aseptic filling process has taken place.

It s also a useful how-to guide to creating a food company with integrity and managing it through the peaks and valleys of the business cycle. ","http://www.foodprocessing.com/blogs/thescoop/an-entrepreneurs-guide-to-food-industry-success/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 15:37:00 -0400","NA","An Entrepreneur s Guide to Food Industry SuccessAdvice is cheap, but advice from a successful food industry entrepreneur is worth a listen by the thousands of start-ups that have burst onto the scene in recent years.

The entrepreneur in question is Jim Koch, founder and brewer of Sam Adams beer. He s also former president and CEO of Boston Beer Company Inc., the company that did for craft beer what hundreds of food start-ups are trying to do for free-from and better-for-you products that are trying to: disrupt the food & beverage mainstream.

Thirty-two years after he left a safe and stolid job as a management consultant and 31 years after selling his first 4,000 cases to Boston bars and restaurants, Koch s  Quench Your Own Thirst: Business Lessons Learned Over a Beer or Two  has been published by Flatiron Books.

It s become almost standard practice for food start-ups to focus on sales and marketing while farming out production to a copacker. It was somewhat unusual in 1984, particularly in the craft beer business. While his contemporaries were committing limited capital into equipment and then fighting an often losing battle to gain distribution, Koch and his partner drafted a hit list of 100 Boston watering holes with clientele deemed adventurous enough to sample a richer, fresher tasting brew than the existing market could offer. By the time he took delivery of the first batch order from Pittsburgh Brewing Co. in April 1985, he was well on the way to converting every surviving bar and restaurant on that list to a Sam Adams customer.

Patience, a superior product and a high-touch sales force were crucial components.  It took four years to get the formulation right,  says Koch,  and drinkers might love it or hate it, but nobody said  It s just another beer.  No one would mistake a Sam Adams for a Bud or Coors. It was a revolution to the taste buds of the drinker. 

Retail distributors weren t interested in carrying a product without any advertising behind it. Koch couldn t afford six-pack cartons, anyway, making foodservice the distribution channel of necessity. A company s culture and values in this case, a commitment to better beer--can be leveraged to form personal relationships, he reasoned.  I didn t have a lot of money or resources, but I had table tents, and I took the time and effort to put them up in bars and restaurants after asking in a nice and thoughtful way and explaining,  This will help you make money.  We were David for so long, and people want to support the little guy. 

Sales reps also asked managers to put Boston Lager on the back bar, at eye level.  Eye level boosts sales 60 percent, and there is no amount of advertising you can do to boost sales 60 percent,  he says. The same request would later be made to retailers.  They would shift Bud below, and if you asked them why, they d say,  Because August Busch never came into my store.  

Even after three decades, Koch continues to call on retailers and foodservice managers one or two days a week.  It can be demanding and grueling,  he allows, but  when the guy who actually makes the product visits, it has an impact.  It also provides an understanding of how that customer makes money.

Continuous innovation and a refusal to rest on one s laurels also have been critical to Boston Beer s success. In 1988, the firm pioneered freshness dating, buying back and destroying the equivalent in today s dollars of $6 million of out-of-code beer from distributors. Long before other brewers recognized drinkers  thirst for variety, specialty and seasonal styles joined Sam in the lineup. Other craft brewers may look down their noses at reduced calorie beer or malternatives like Twisted Tea, but that last product rings up $200 million in annual sales.

 The rest of the world is looking to the United States for innovation and quality in beer,  says Koch. Every month, he hosts German brewers who visit to learn  how are we able to get 20-somethings excited about beer. Beer is boring in Germany,  where young adults are turning to wine, instead.

Based on the book s disparagement of marketing, you d suspect Koch had a bad encounter with a marketer as a child. Nonetheless, pull-through marketing in the form of advertising and promotion is one of Boston Beer s distinguishing features. It s unclear who actually coined the term craft beer, but there s no question who popularized it. Thirteen months after introducing Sam to the market, Koch was promoting it on WBCN radio as part of a barter deal.  Take whatever publicity we can get and always look for more  was the simple strategy. Ten years later, the first ads aired on TV.

The conventional wisdom holds that successful food startups eventually are acquired by large corporations, where ingredient compromises and production shortcuts gradually degrade the end product. The alternative scenario is a public stock offering that results in the founder s loss of control. Koch rewrote that script in 1995 with an IPO in which he retained all the voting shares, a tactic copied by Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Google s Sergey Brin and Larry Page. In the process, he stuck a finger in Wall Street s eye, giving 130,000 drinkers an opportunity to buy shares at a price $5 a share below the opening-day price paid by institutional investors.

Conventional wisdom also suggests that, beyond a certain point, entrepreneurs must turn control over to professional managers. While he gave up the titles of president and CEO long ago, he remains firmly in control as chairman of a $1 billion company. Citing the example of Steve Jobs and others, Koch notes,  It s turned out that founder-led companies have tended to outperform other companies. 

 Quench Your Own Thirst  tells the story of Sam Adams & Co. and the nonlinear growth of the craft beer movement that Koch played a central role in instigating. It s also a useful how-to guide to creating a food company with integrity and managing it through the peaks and valleys of the business cycle.","F&B"
"New Study Proves no Adverse Effects of Carrageenan","Two years of research finds no inflammation in human cells.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/new-study-proves-no-adverse-effects-of-carrageenan/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 13:45:00 -0400","NA","New Study Proves no Adverse Effects of CarrageenanA new study on carrageenan, an ingredient key to delivering stability, texture and nutrients in many foods and beverages, demonstrates the ingredient does not induce inflammation in human cells as claimed by some critics.

The study, which was conducted by internationally recognized toxicologist and carrageenan expert Dr. James M. McKim Jr., was recently accepted for publication by the peer-reviewed journal Food and Toxicology. This study represents the culmination of two years of research that was unable to replicate any of the findings of carrageenan critics, including Dr. Joanne Tobacman, who claim the food ingredient contributes to certain adverse health outcomes.

Publication of McKim's study raises major questions about the validity of Tobacman's conclusions and underscores the importance of replicating scientific results in different laboratories and by multiple researchers. McKim's research was designed to investigate several recent studies Tobacman has cited as evidence of her claims that carrageen causes inflammation and is harmful.

Not only was McKim unable to replicate the negative effects Tobacman reported, his research showed carrageenan has no measurable effects on cells and provides strong evidence that carrageenan consumed in foods and beverages would not cause inflammation in humans.","F&B"
"Dairy Farmers Ask USDA for Help With Cheese Glut","Dairy farmers saw milk prices have plunged to their lowest point in years, prompting them to request the USDA for assistance in buying up tens of thousands of tons of cheese.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/dairy-farmers-ask-usda-for-help-with-cheese-glut/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 11:51:00 -0400","NA","Dairy Farmers Ask USDA for Help With Cheese GlutAs farmers' milk prices have plunged to their lowest point since October 2009, cheese stockpiles are swelling, which led dairy farmers to seek help from agricultural officials to buy up tens of thousands of tons of cheese to bail them out. On Aug. 12, Jim Mulhern, CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, Arlington, Va., sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, requesting that the government buy $150 million worth of cheese to assist the struggling dairy farmers, and provide 90 million lb. of food to needy Americans, the Wall Street Journal reported.

""Dairy producers here in the United States need assistance,"" wrote Mulhern. A spokesman for the USDA said the regulatory body ""shares the concerns for our nation s dairy farmers, who like many in the farm community are facing tight margins,"" and that the department would review the letter.

While dairy processors have been able to wrangle low milk costs to higher profitability in recent quarters, milk prices for farmers plunged 13 percent in the past year to around $1.25 a gallon, amid a barnyard-wide glut in agricultural commodities, the WSJ report added. Favorable weather in the U.S. and skyrocketing production globally have kept prices down on staple grains as well as the milk and the meat of animals that feed on them.

The farmers' problems mounted after the USDA forecast record corn and soybean harvests this fall, a bounty that likely would push down prices even further. In addition, stockpiles of cheeses from cheddar to feta have swelled in June to a record 1.25 billion lbs.

Such buyouts have occurred in the past when the USDA purchased other commodities such as peanuts and chicken after an avian influenza outbreak triggered an export ban that decimated U.S. poultry prices. Warehousing millions of pounds of cheese across the country can keep it frozen for years as dairy processors hold out for higher prices. Officials often distribute such surpluses to U.S. school-lunch programs, food banks or develop new products featuring cheese as a component.

""This type of assistance would both help economically strapped farmers, and also help those without ready access to nutritious dairy products,"" Mulhern's letter stated on behalf of the federation s members.","F&B"

"Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave Purchase","The Cornucopia Institute is contesting the acquisition of WhiteWave Foods by  Groupe Danone as being anti-competitive in the U.S. organic milk and organic yogurt markets.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/complaints-filed-over-danones-white-wave-purchase/","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 12:49:00 -0400","NA","Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave PurchaseThe proposed acquisition by French food giant Groupe Danone of WhiteWave Foods is being contested by an industry watchdog, the Cornucopia Institute, which says the move ""will have a serious anti-competitive effect on the organic yogurt and organic fluid milk markets in the U.S.""

The Wisconsin-based institute filed complaints with both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, stating the acquisition would also have a negative economic impact on U.S. organic dairy farmers.

At a purchase price exceeding $10 billion, the deal would combine Stonyfield, Horizon and Wallaby to dominate the organic dairy market. Horizon organic milk controls nearly 25 percent of the organic milk market, while its Silk brand is a leader in plant-based beverages. Danone would be taking control of a bigger piece of the organic dairy market than has ever been controlled by a single company before, says the institute, which also launched a petition drive pushing for a full investigation of the proposed merger by federal regulators.

""With this acquisition, we are concerned that Danone will easily be able to beat out any competition by lowering prices beyond what farmstead dairies, and more moderately sized milk processors and marketers, can withstand,"" said Marie Burcham, a livestock policy analyst with the Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit organization representing farms and consumers with interests in the organic dairy market.

The market for organic dairy already has less competition than other agricultural sectors and is more susceptible to monopolization, Burcham continued. ""It is important that the authorities look at the anti-competitive implications of the Danone-WhiteWave deal,"" she added. ""We ask that they consider the organic dairy and organic yogurt markets in particular as different and already more concentrated markets in comparison to Danone s other, non-organic market share.""","F&B"

"Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First Year","Vegan mayonnaise company told workers, contractors to quietly buy hundreds of jars of Just Mayo to inflate sales.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/hampton-creek-buyback/","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 15:27:00 -0400","NA","Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First YearVegan mayonnaise creator Hampton Creek Inc. pumped up first-year sales and general buzz by having employees and contractors buy up jars of its Just Mayo, according to an investigation by Bloomberg News.

The news medium reported Aug 4. it had uncovered payment receipts and talked to former employees and contractors who were told to go to Safeway and other early retailers of the product in 2014 and buy hundreds of jars and otherwise talk up the product while hiding the fact they were employed by Hampton Creek.

Entrepreneur/founder Josh Tetrick, who remains CEO of the company, admitted the tactic but said it amounts to about $77,000, representing less than 0.12 percent of the company s sales. Bloomberg hinted that it could be much more, but did not specify an amount.

Tetrick said the tactic was more about quality control than trying to inflate sales. He said the employees and contractors were told to check jars for misaligned labels, breakage or issues involving ingredient separation, which he said occurred early on when the pea protein spread was exposed to extreme temperatures in transit.

Whichever, it certainly helped Tetrick raise an early $90 million to fund his startup. We profiled Tetrick and Hampton Creek in a September 2015 cover story titled ""Hero or Hustler?"" -- a story that made Food Processing and Managing Editor Kevin Higgins a finalist in the coveted Jesse Neal Awards.

 We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos,  Caroline Love, Hampton Creek s then-director of corporate partnership, wrote in an April 2014 e-mail to contract workers, which Bloomberg obtained.  And we re going to pay you for this exciting new project! Below is the list of stores that have been assigned to you. 

Former workers say Hampton Creek also purchased its own products at Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target and Whole Foods locations across the country. While a November 2014 e-mail from the corporate partnerships team said the company would stop store buyouts, three former contractors who worked for the company in 2015 say the practice continued, but directions became verbal, not written, according to Bloomberg.

Five former Hampton Creek contractors and two ex-senior staff members say the buyback assignments were separate from quality checks at stores. The ex-contractors say in most cases they were told to simply buy up jars at nearby stores and were free to consume or discard them, not look for quality issues, according to the Bloomberg story.

One former contractor provided receipts showing purchases of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a single day. Another contractor said he bought at least 20 jars per store after being directed to visit more than a dozen stores in less than a week.

In that crucial time period, from April 2014 to April 2015, Hampton Creek's grocery store sales were $4.6 million, not including sales at Whole Foods, according to an IRI report cited by Fast Company. Sales more than doubled the following year, and Tetrick told the magazine he expects $100 million in sales this year.

Since Hampton Creek is a privately held company, it may not have broken any laws.","F&B"

We don t mean to make this into some kind of competition, especially since the numbers you see involve some interpretation by us. But it is worth noting that Tyson unseated PepsiCo, which had held the No. 1 position on the chart for five years. This is not Tyson s first turn as the No. 1 company; the Arkansas firm in 2006 ended a 30-year run by Kraft Foods.

It s also a good scorecard for the general health of the food and beverage industry. Looking beyond the top-line sales figures tells a lot about the current state of business ... although generalizations are hard to come up with.

It s safe to call that a mixed bag, certainly not a stellar performance across the board. But it s never easy, is it? Even the star performers within the chart did well mostly because of sizable acquisitions. Tyson is one, its sales growing by more than 11 percent, although that $4 billion bump entirely may be due to its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. But its 43 percent increase in net income is a testament to its management of this big acquisition and the debt it involved.

J.M. Smucker is in the same two boats. Its $2 billion sales increase (thanks to its purchase of Big Heart Pet Brands) is great, but its nearly 100 percent increase in profit took real finesse.

Less worthy of compliment is Post Holdings  near-doubling of sales (due to the acquisitions of MOM Brands and Michael Foods), which only kept it $115 million in red ink.

Deal-making in the food and beverage industry set a new record in 2014, hitting 510. Despite being 18 percent lower, 410 transactions made last year was one of the busiest years for buying and selling food & beverage companies, according to records compiled by The Food Institute.

The number of food industry mergers may be down in 2015, but Mergermarket estimates the value of deals in the food segment reached a near-record high of $120.8 billion, jumping 57.8 percent from even that record prior year. What is causing this gap between transactions and value? Megadeals. Megadeals are becoming more popular as companies find the only way to keep their share of the market is to merge with the competition.

And 2015 saw its share of megadeals. The poster child was the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Co.

In meats, the big deal was JBS USA Pork s acquisition of Cargill's U.S. pork business for about $1.4 billion. In poultry, Perdue Farms bought Natural Food Holdings from LNK Partners, including the Niman Ranch and Prairie Grove brands.

In the Food Institute's ""other"" category, McCormick & Co. made three acquisitions, buying One World Foods for approximately $100 million, Brand Aromatics for $63 million, and Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately $97 million. Seafood processors were noticeably more active in 2015 than in previous years, taking part in almost as many deals in 2015 as in the previous five years combined, but all of them relatively small.

The Food Institute (www.foodinstitute.com), a nonprofit organization founded to collect and disseminate information about the industry, includes in its definition of the food industry a number of entities beyond food and beverage processors.","F&B"
"Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher Profits","After a year of cost-cutting, many companies are improving their bottom lines at the expense of their top lines.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/top-100-food-companies/","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 09:27:00 -0400","NA","Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher ProfitsUsually, our Top 100  table shows a healthy food and beverage industry with sales and profits on the rise   as should be expected in a year in which the country s overall economy is plugging along, albeit without setting records.

Look a little closer at the figures and the underlying situations, and we see an industry struggling to achieve growth. Especially among the bigger firms. Only one of the 16 largest companies saw sales grow appreciably in 2015, and that company, Tyson, did so mostly through a huge acquisition. All the others undoubtedly made some acquisitions in the past year, which didn t do enough to prop up sales.

Tyson, by the way, is the new No. 1 company atop the U.S. and Canadian food and beverage industry, thanks to the $4 billion bump by former No. 32 company Hillshire Brands. Tyson was No. 1 back in 2006, having ended about a 30-year run by Kraft Foods as the largest food & beverage processor in the U.S. and Canada. This time, it ended PepsiCo s five-year turn atop our list.

 We have an incredible team at Tyson Foods and our focus on consumer-relevant categories is what got us here,  CEO Donnie Smith told us when he learned of the No. 1 ranking.  We ve invested in our prepared foods brands, chicken and the insights that drive innovation for a better consumer experience. 

For the overall food and beverage industry, profits are a slightly better picture   maybe. Net income was up at five of the top 16   which means the bottom line worsened for eight. (No. 11 Mars is a private company and doesn t tell us profits and for No. 5 Kraft Heinz we had no 2014 figure to compare its profit to.)

As we prepared this report, AdvancePierre Foods was planning an initial public offering of stock. The six-year-old Cincinnati company was seeking to raise $100 million but it will remain majority-owned by Oaktree Capital. APF is the result of a 2010 merger of Pierre Foods, Advance Food Co. and Advance Brands   and Advance Brands itself was a joint venture between Advance Food Co. and Cargill Meat Solutions. Hostess Brands, which had a soap opera of bankruptcies in 2004 and 2012, was sold off in pieces in its 2013 liquidation. But the biggest part and the name went to investor C. Dean Metropoulos and his Apollo Global Management LLC. Now, in a complex transaction, Metropoulos and Apollo Global Management will transfer ownership to newly formed Gores Holdings, but they will hold a 42 percent stake in Gores Holdings. Gores Holdings reportedly plans to reintroduce Hostess as a publicly listed company, perhaps late this year, with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.3 billion.

Mondelez is a great case in point. While the North American-only figures show a tiny improvement, worldwide sales were down nearly $5 billion; but net income nearly tripled from 2014 to a sensational $7.3 billion.

The view is only a little better at the bottom third of our table, where 12 of the 33 smaller companies gained sales ground and seven improved profits.

The figures punctuate the stories told at the Consumer Analysts Group of New York conference, where the top food and beverage companies annually make presentations to financial analysts. At that February meeting, the CEOs and CFOs of Campbell Soup, General Mills, Hormel and Mondelez all said recent years of cost-cutting are paying off in increased profits but decreased sales. Even at that meeting, Tyson happily bucked the trend, predicting both sales and profits would turn higher this year.

 The food processing industry tends to track the U.S. economy and therefore continues to grow at a steady pace,  says Casey Garten, managing director of food and agribusiness at Bank of the West Commercial Banking Group.  The industry is well capitalized with interest rates at historic lows, which provides opportunities for growth to meet growing demand. 

There are three big gainers on the table, all the result of full-year effects of major acquisitions. As previously stated, Tyson added $4 billion in sales largely because of its late-2014 purchase of Hillshire Brands. J.M. Smucker (whose 2016 fiscal year ended this April 30) grew 37 percent and moved from No. 23 last year to No. 17 this year thanks to the early-2015 acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands   the former Del Monte unit that includes Gravy Train and Meow Mix   and its $2.3 billion in sales.","F&B"

 This is an ideal partnership for many reasons,  said William A. Terlato, chief executive officer of Terlato Wines, in a statement.  Quality has always come first for us, and Feudi San Gregorio has set the bar extremely high on quality. Secondly, there is great synergy with owner Antonio Capaldo and CEO Pierpaolo Sirch. We are pleased to add Feudi San Gregorio's Campania wines to our exceptional portfolio of Italian wines. 

Terlato Wines will import eight estate wines from Feudi San Gregorio, including two Taurasi wines and two Aglianico wines, plus Falanghina, Fiano di Avellino, Greco di Tufo and a ros  of Aglianico. All feature labels are designed by artist Massimo Vignelli.

Terlato is known for the quality of its portfolio, and we're proud to be a part of it. Since the beginning, we wanted to prove that indigenous wines from Campania can be as beautiful, balanced and expressive as any wine in the world. With Terlato, we're excited to bring Feudi San Gregorio to a larger audience in America. 

Feudi San Gregorio was founded in 1986 in the village of Sorbo Serpico, in the Avellino province of Campania, after an earthquake devastated much of the region, the company says. For Avellino native Enzo Ercolino, it triggered a calling, to establish a wine estate that could help restore the area to its former greatness, it adds.

Today, the winery is owned by the Capaldo family, with Antonio Capaldo at the helm. The winery features a tasting room; Marenna, a Michelin-starred restaurant led by Chef Paolo Barrale; and a luxury guest house.","F&B"

"Beverage market prepares for labeling changes","It s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89511-beverage-market-prepares-for-labeling-changes","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 -0400","NA","Beverage market prepares for labeling changesIt s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration released the new Nutrition Facts label. Among the changes include bolder and larger type for calories, serving size as well as changes to nutrients required. However, the biggest impacts will be an update to the serving sizes to reflect the amount that consumers typically will consume as well as including an Added Sugar section under the Total Sugars section.

Many beverage-makers already have updated their serving sizes, but the added sugars will be a new component. Brand owners will have until July 26, 2018, to comply with the requirements, while beverage manufacturers with less than $10 million a year in sales will have an additional year.

However, this isn t the only labeling change likely to impact beverage-makers. In July, the U.S. Senate and House passed national GMO-labeling legislation. As of press time, President Barack Obama had not signed this legislation into law.

According to an Associated Press article, the law will require most food and beverage packages to carry a text label, a symbol or an electronic code readable by smartphone that indicates whether the product contains GMOs. The Department of Agriculture will have two years to write the new rules based on this legislation, the article added.

But just like the proactive nature of the beverage market, brand owners already are embracing change. The Beer Institute announced a new initiative to encourage its member companies to display specific consumer information on their products, packaging or websites.

The Brewers  Voluntary Disclosure Initiative states beer companies will voluntarily include a serving facts statement on products, disclose ingredients on either the labels or secondary packaging via a list of ingredients, and provide a reference to a website with the information or a QR code, the association says.

Among the companies agreeing to this standard are Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, Heineken USA, Constellation Brands Beer Division, North American Breweries and Craft Brew Alliance.","F&B"

For the quarter, the company generated a consolidated net sales growth of 15 percent. Net sales for beer increased 19 percent, the company says.

 We successfully kicked off our 120 Day of Summer selling season by posting depletion growth of almost 10 percent,  Sands said.  At retail, Constellation was the No. 1 gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market.

 In what continues to be an incredibly volatile global macro environment, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter,  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said in a statement.  While reported net revenue performance was negatively impacted by foreign exchanges translation and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, we delivered balanced volume growth and positive price/mix driven by relentless execution of our commercial agenda and leading to solid organic revenue growth. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiency throughout or operations contributed significantly to attractive margin expansion while we continued to invest in our business. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year core constant currency EPS growth objective. 

According to the company, net revenue declined 3.3 percent, due to a negative 4 percent impact by foreign exchange translation and a minus 2.5 percent impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation. Organic revenue, excluding these factors, increased 3.3 percent, the company says.

Reported operating profit increased 2 percent, while core constant currency operating profit increased 4 percent, the company says.

PepsiCo s North America Beverages (NAB) was positively impacted during the quarter by productivity gains, lower raw-material costs, favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals and insurance adjustments, partially offset by operating cost inflation, it adds.

The company reports that net revenue has declined 3.1 percent, while organic revenue grew 3.4 percent year-to-date. Additionally, reported operating profit declined 2 percent and core constant currency operating profit increased 7 percent, it says.","F&B"

Not only was Times Square considerably cleaner, but what stood out, literally, were the towering digital billboards that flashed advertising, promos for upcoming TV shows, events and movies and more.

From the top of a double-decker bus, unconventional advertisements of several beverage brands also resonated. For example, a huge red-and-white Budweiser ad was plastered on the side of a building. With the five-ringed Olympic logo in place, the graphically interesting, sports- themed ad featured male and female athletes playing soccer, throwing a javelin, running and preparing to hit the water.

Another billboard featured the 5-calorie goodness of Bai, proclaiming its  High Fashion Flavor and Thrift Store Calories.  Bai also made news last month as it was the only beverage recognized by New York-based Nielsen as a 2016 U.S. Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award winner. In a statement, Nielsen said it reviewed nearly 3,500 consumer products that were introduced in the consumer packaged goods market in 2014, recognizing 18 that help to improve daily routines, it said. It also noted that it was the first time two start-up companies, one being Bai, were recognized.

Many other brands, like the sports drink beverage BODYARMOR, ramp up interest in their products using traditional marketing such as social media, field and event marketing or by simply having consumers try their products. These tactics seem to be working for BODYARMOR, which is experiencing triple-digit growth. For more information, see the cover story.

Regardless of the ways today s beverage brands are marketing themselves, it s likely that they will continue to use both conventional and high-tech ways to get noticed.","F&B"
"Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipment","An increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89522-beverage-packaging-trends-impact-labeling-equipment","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:48:00 -0400","NA","Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipmentAn increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.

Recently, beverage brands are embracing the idea of personalization on packaging. For example, in May, Atlanta-based The Coca-Cola Co. expanded on its Share a Coke campaign, which featured labels with common names, with its Share a Song campaign, which includes Coca-Cola labels featuring song lyrics. Additionally, the company s Diet Coke brand launched the It s Mine campaign, featuring 12-ounce contour glass bottles with full-body shrink-sleeve labels decorated in myriad designs.

Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group has embraced personalization as well when its Dr Pepper brand launched the Pick Your Pepper campaign this summer. The Pick Your Pepper custom-label bottles leverage unique digital technology in which text, graphics and images can be changed from one printed piece to the next in mass quantity, the company says.

As these types of campaigns continue to prove effective and grow in popularity, labeling equipment has had to accommodate.  Recent trends indicate that it is no longer enough for producers to simply deliver a quality product in a package with a label; consumers today prefer beverages that reflect their individual needs and preferences,  says Michele Morrone, a member of Norcross, Ga.-based Sidel s Labelling Product Management Team.  That is because key contributors to success over the past year or so have been personalization and products that match the consumer s lifestyle. Understanding how to build end-user engagement, producers today need to be fast, flexible and willing to challenge convention. 

He adds:  The popularity of beverage label personalization is increasing significantly, with smaller batch sizes and tighter timing being natural consequences of this trend. This means a challenge for the labeling process in terms of flexibility as customized labels must be designed and produced quickly. 

Bill Hernandez, sales director for packaging at Karlville, Miami, notes that digital printing has been one major trend impacting beverage labels; however, it does not impact the labeling machinery.  The digital print technology has majorly impacted the flexible packaging machinery, but not as much the labeling equipment,  he explains.  For the change to shrink-sleeve application machinery to work smoothly on this kind of printing, it is recommended to use reverse-printing on the label in order to create less friction when the label is sliding through the mandrel.

 The benefits of the digital printing are less time obtaining the material, less scrap ratio, and the possibility for brands to personalize the label faster and use less amounts of material,  Hernandez continues.  Other types of printing in the shrink-sleeve industry usually are offset, flexo [and] gravure. 

Sidel s Morrone notes that the market for shrink-sleeve labeling (SSL) is growing.  SSL offers the potential to reinforce branding and to create eye-catching designs to appeal to the consumer and make the product stand out from the competition,  he explains.  It can combine great flexibility and labeling quality and, in addition, presents the possibility of using all film material types.   The label sleeve can also serve effectively as a seal and, in the case of sensitive beverages, it can be used as a light-barrier. 

Because the sleeve is heat-shrunk, it eliminates container shape restrictions, and removes glue and solvents, making it easier for the PET raw material to be recycled, he adds.

Although SSL is growing in popularity, roll-fed, self-adhesive and pressure-sensitive labeling methods also are common and effective, according to Morrone.

Customization is a trend that shows no signs of slowing down, he adds.  Inventing ways in which the consumer experience can be made more personal is a current tend within packaging, which is set to continue,  Morrone explains.  The introduction of  iprinting,  which allows printing directly onto the bottle, is adding even greater possibilities for personalization. 

Unique, customized packaging shapes and sizes also are impacting labeling equipment, says Justin Slarks, director of marketing for Sleeve Seal, Little Rock, Ark.  Sleeve Seal has been busy keeping up with the needs of manufacturers that are labeling unique bottles and shapes at speed,  he says.  We have machines running at 720-plus [bottles per minute] (BPM) on bottles that require orientation and have tight tolerances on label placement. The trend seems to be stylized packaging that creates a unique look on the store shelves. 

However they re applied, labels have become more important than ever, Morrone says.  [A] label can attract the consumer s attention and encourage them to select one beverage over another,  he says.  So, it s even more important for a brand to stand out on the supermarket shelf. Today s manufacturer, therefore, needs to be able to adapt and change quickly in order to react to market conditions. So, more than ever before, real flexibility within its labeling solutions is really important for any beverage producer. 

Yet, similar to many other aspects within beverage operations, a desire for higher production rates and flexibility is not new. As SKUs continue to proliferate, there s a higher necessity to increase production time in order to quickly and efficiently accommodate product changeover.

 We see a trend toward increased machine uptime and efficiency requirements as being paramount to our customers,  says Neal Konstantin, president of PDC International, Norwalk, Conn.  Flexibility is only second to efficiency. Machines need wide capability ranges and quick, tool-less changeovers from one format to the next. 

He notes that a beverage manufacturer should look for equipment with robust design, which can allow for 24/7 uptime and reliable operation.

PDC International recently launched two new pieces of labeling equipment. Its Conform Series 140F Steam Tunnel has five individually adjustable steam zones, which offer greater shrink quality and consistency while labeling 300 containers a minute, the company says. The PDC R-350 Evolution Shrink Sleeve labeler is a multi-use shrink-sleeve labeler that processes as many as 400 difficult-to-label containers a minute, it says. The system features a tool-less changeover feature and is ideal for thin films, it adds.

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the importance that changeover flexibility has to co-packaging companies.  Flexibility is extremely important,  he says.  Co-packers want robust machines that allow for format changes at affordable prices. Machines that allow simple changeover without retraining operators are invaluable. 

According to Slarks, the company offers durable, highly efficient machines that can precisely label using affordable change parts.  Our user interface is user-friendly, and we offer on-board reference libraries and tutorials,  he says.

Changeovers are one aspect of the operation in which experts note flexibility is most essential.  It is highly important when it comes to changeovers [that] the operator can change in the least amount of time from one product production to another with different specifications,  Karlville s Hernandez explains.  As machinery providers, we need to make sure the changeovers are friendly enough for our customers, like [when] changing a production from a 6-ounce bottle to a 32-ounce bottle in less than 20 minutes. This change in production includes changing recipient, label, [the] type of label application, machine parts and tunnel heat set-up, among other changes. In order for these changeovers to be [done] in the least amount of time, the company should have specific set-up sheets and proper training.

 The automation definitively is important for efficiencies in the complete product line,  he continues.  In labeling machinery, in order to support the productivity of the labeling line, we work [on] implementing automation as much as possible [with] regards to changeovers. Not only changeovers made from size-to-size of the containers, but also changeovers from roll-to-roll. 

Karlville offers many labeling equipment solutions, Hernandez says.  In our environment inside Karlville, for the shrink-sleeve lines we are building and supplying machines that run up to 800 [containers] per minute,  he says.  We offer standard tunnels and dry steam tunnels, which is new technology, together with the Tornado and other tunnels. We also keep up with technology on thinner materials [of] up to 25-macron with materials PVC, PET and OPS. 

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the effects that the proliferation and innovation in automation has had on labeling equipment.  As automation reaches new speeds, the labeling machines need to keep up with the other machines in the line. Line speeds are only as fast as the slowest piece of equipment, so as other machines gain speed, labelers have to keep up. 

Sidel s Morrone explains that to keep up with the pace of automation, main mechanical parts involved in labeling machines increasingly are being replaced with servo-motors.  This is a huge impact,  he says.  The management and synchronization of all the functions becomes much more sophisticated. The information control of the process parameters for setting, maintenance and trouble-shooting is much more accurate. It reduces the need for manual intervention as adjustments can be made via the human machine interface. This also reduces maintenance and lubrication requirements. 

According to Morrone, Sidel offers solutions for many different types of labels, including shrink-sleeves, roll-fed, pressure sensitive or pre-cut.

Looking ahead, experts agree that thinner labeling materials are in store.  The speeds of other related equipment seemed to have plateaued, so the next step is a change in materials,  Slarks says.  Plus, thinner materials offer fewer changeovers, more cost-effective shipping and lower costs per impression. 

Karlville s Hernandez echoes similar sentiments.  The future for the shrink-sleeve equipment is to continue improving the application of thinner materials to lower the cost of the label, to continue to make the machinery smaller and more compact and to continue improving speeds,  he says.","F&B"

However, that might not be the case based on a national Career Builder survey conducted by Harris Poll. According to the survey, 54 percent of employees stated they went into work when sick because they felt the work wouldn t get done otherwise. Further, nearly half (48 percent) said that they couldn t afford to miss a day of pay, according to data from the survey, which was conducted online from Aug. 12 to Sept. 2, 2015, and included a representative sample of 3,321 full-time workers and 2,326 hiring managers and human resource professionals across industries and company sizes.

With such a high percentage of the labor force indicating that they are willing to work even when under the weather, it makes staying healthy that much more important.

 The market for immune-health products has seen significant growth in the past decade   both across multiple immune health market segments (sports nutrition, healthy aging, and moms and children) and from a reactive and proactive healthcare approach,  says Donald J. Cox, senior vice president of research and development for Wellmune, a division of Beloit, Wis.-based Kerry s nutrition and general wellness portfolio.  As shown by a 2015 Canadean (formerly Datamonitor) study with nearly 28,000 consumers in over 30 markets, immune health was the No. 2 most desired functional benefit consumers want in a food or beverage. This is second only to general health and wellness. 

Mike Bush, president of Cleveland-based Ganeden and executive board president of the International Probiotics Association, also notes how relevant immune health is to today s consumers.  Consumers are looking for functional foods and beverages that provide additional health benefits, immune support included,  he says.  A recent consumer survey conducted found that out of respondents who did not typically purchase beverages, healthy consumers would be at least 29 percent more likely to purchase new beverages if they claimed immune support. Food and beverage manufacturers are responding with new, healthy products that include benefits like immune support. 

Bush notes that there are a few consumer trends contributing to this shift.  Consumers are becoming more proactively health conscious but also experiencing pill fatigue,  he says.  Functional beverages give them the opportunity to get the health benefits they re looking for in products that are easy to incorporate in a daily routine. 

Although functional food and beverage development that targets immune health is on the rise, there still is much more in the pipeline,  experts note.

 While immune/digestive health products are a large and growing business across the globe, what s interesting is that the growth of functional foods, beverages and supplements may still be in its early stages,  Kerry s Cox says.  This is because consumers  search for products created to provide specific health benefits is a recent phenomenon. Twenty years ago consumers focused absent nutritional negatives (low sodium, refined sugar, artificial sweeteners). They ve since come to accept the presence of nutritional positives (calcium, fiber) but now are seeking targeted functional benefits (immune health, heart health, energy, digestion).

 Driving this shift are consumers who are taking a long-term approach to their health, moving from reactive, short-term fixes to a more proactive, preventative approach,  he continues.  As [previously] mentioned, with long-term immune health at the forefront of consumers  concerns, an unmet demand for innovative products that can deliver proactively and proven immune health benefits is driving the growing functional food, beverage and supplement markets. 

Cox notes that because of consumers on-the-go lifestyles, consumer packaged goods (CPG) that carry an immune health claim will fit in with the current trends of functional products.

 We see interest in the development of immune products spanning across food, beverage and supplement categories including sports nutrition, healthy aging, children s health and stress, including products like [ready-to-drink] (RTD) beverages, effervescent, shots, powdered mixes, etc.,  he says.

With a demand for products that support a healthy immune system, beverage-makers are turning to ingredient suppliers to guide them in fulfilling this need state.

Cox notes that formulation can be a key component of product differentiation for consumers. As such, beverage-makers are asking what ingredients can be used to develop these immune-health products and how they will help meet consumer demands.

 What will lead the charge for meeting consumer demand is a product that includes functional ingredients backed by credible research, which offers simple product claims that resonate with consumers,  he says.  This is because more often than not, many functional ingredients fail to convey compelling claims that set them apart from other immune-boosting products. 

To fulfill this need, Kerry bolstered its nutrition portfolio when it purchased Wellmune last year. A natural immune system booster, Wellmune is a 100 percent natural food, beverage, and supplement ingredient, the company says.

 Wellmune is one of the best immune-support ingredients documented for all life stages and can be formulated into most products,  Cox says.  Wellmune is a natural beta 1,3/1,6 glucan derived from the cell wall of a highly purified, proprietary strain of baker s yeast. Wellmune is a nutritional ingredient found in food, beverages and supplements in over 60 countries globally, is safe for everyday use and has the ability to boost immune function without over stimulating the immune system. 

Most recently, Juxx launched X-mune in Brazil. The juice beverage contains several fruits and vegetables as well as Wellmune. However, brand owners aren t limited to only immune-boosting functionality.

 We get requests not only for standalone immune health products but multi-function products that offer several benefits,  Cox explains.  Whether it is a single benefit (immune enhancement) and/or products offering a combination of immunity and other benefits, combining Wellmune with other ingredients such as protein or probiotics gives product manufactures a competitive advantage within their market by providing more function within a single product. 

Ganeden s Bush also notes the value that probiotics can add to formulations.  Many people don t realize that 70 percent of our immune cells are located in our digestive system, which means digestive balance impacts immune health,  he says.  The immune cells in your digestive tract are exposed to, in some cases, thousands of species of naturally occurring bacteria   both good and bad. It s important to keep a healthy level of beneficial bacteria to maintain digestive health, which, in turn, supports immune health. 

To support the digestive system, the company offers its GanedenBC30, which contains the patented probiotic bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086.  Thanks to our patented and science-backed probiotic strain, GanedenBC30, consumers can now conveniently get their daily dose of probiotics through everyday beverages,  Bush explains.  Research shows that GanedenBC30 is an excellent probiotic choice with immune benefits. When the body is presented with various antigens, GanedenBC30 has been shown in studies to help the body defend itself and support immune health. Multiple studies show that GanedenBC30 positively affects a large number of blood markers in the body that correlate to positive immune modulation. 

Although immune health products are in demand, beverage companies as well as ingredient suppliers understand that the product will only be successful if it can back up its claims.

 In general, efficacy and stability are concerns in probiotic products, so beverage manufacturers should make sure to work with ingredient companies that have the science behind their claims and provide testing and formulation assistance,  Bush says.

To ensure the efficacy and stability of its partners  products, Ganeden performs detailed lab testing that studies the manufacturing of these products and the performance of GanedenBC30 within them, to ensure that it remains beneficial to consumers.

 With thousands of products tested over the years, Ganeden works with its partners to ensure best-of-class stability in a variety of products,  Bush says.

For example, GanedenBC30 features a structure and protective spore that allows it to survive most manufacturing processes, tout a three-year shelf life and transport through the digestive tract, he says.

 GanedenBC30 is a spore-forming strain, and its stability makes it extremely easy to formulate with,  Bush explains.  This allows it to be added into virtually any beverage from any category. Shelf-stable beverages can be a challenge, but we have found solutions to provide probiotic benefits through dispenser caps, straws and other technologies. 

Kerry also recognizes the importance that efficacy plays in its Wellmune ingredient.

 It is quite simple: Successful functional food, beverage and supplement products start with safe, efficacious ingredients supported by numerous peer-reviewed clinical studies,  Cox says.

He adds that when evaluating the efficacy of an ingredient, a beverage formulator should ask the following questions:

For Wellmune , the ingredient has been tested in numerous peer-reviewed clinical studies that have shown its ability to enhance key immune functions, improve overall physical health, maintain healthy energy levels, help maintain health during times of stress and provide immune support as people age, it says.

 Our latest clinical study, which was recently published in the Journal of Nutrition & Food Sciences, demonstrates Wellmune s ability to help keep children significantly healthier by decreasing episodes of common childhood illnesses and symptoms of illness such as upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (URTI),  Cox says.

Going forward, ingredient suppliers anticipate that ingredients that support immune health will continue to proliferate throughout the CPG market, especially beverages.

 There are many opportunities on the horizon for healthy beverages and immune health,  Ganeden s Bush says.  As consumers become more educated on the health benefits they can receive through everyday drinks, we feel that demand will continue to increase for these types of ingredients. Consumers will become better at reading labels, pushing for healthier options with clean ingredients that are science-backed and shown to have benefits. In the coming months Ganeden will be introducing new ingredients that are focused around this specific area and we will keep you posted as we announce progress. ","F&B"

"Falling sales could make leases troublesome"," Blog: Heavy demand for leased sites has driven up costs, and contributed to higher prices. 

  read more  ","http://nrn.com/blog/falling-sales-could-make-leases-troublesome","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 21:06:00 +0000","Sales Trends","Falling sales could make leases troublesomeThis post is part of the On the Margin blog.

We recently asked Jeff Garrett why sales are up at his soon-to-be-10-unit California-based family- dining chain Lumberjacks. One of his explanations surprised us a bit: Patience.

Specifically, his concept waits out until sites open up at rates that are reasonable enough to make a profit even in a downturn.

 In California, it s hard to find a spot,  Garrett said.  Everyone wants $3 to $3.50 per square foot. You can t go into that spot and remodel and pay rent with the minimum wage going up.

 A lot of these restaurants over the next five years are going out of business. 

In March, we wrote about rising lease costs amid intense demand from rapidly growing fast-casual chains and others looking at similar locations. We noted that demands for high rents could cause serious profitability problems if sales fall.

Since then, almost on cue, same-store sales have slowed. Publicly traded chains on average reported same-store sales in the spring that were 170 basis points slower than the previous quarter. The biggest slowdown has come at fast-casual chains where lease costs are especially high given heavy demand for the spaces those restaurants occupy.

According to Black Box Intelligence, only a third of fast-casual chains reported a same-store sales increase in the second quarter. And this is with one of the biggest concepts in that space, Chipotle Mexican Grill, was down well over 20 percent.

Same-store sales continue to slow down. According to MillerPulse, same-store sales have fallen for three straight months since at least 2010. Traffic is down 2.8 percent across the board. That s a major loss of customers.

High lease costs could be contributing to this issue. There is a widening gap in menu price inflation between restaurants and grocers, and many of us believe the lower prices are providing those grocers with an advantage.

Operators are raising prices in part out of fear of rising labor costs. But those operators also have these leases to worry about. And so they push prices higher in the name of maintaining margins.

There s little indication that sales are reversing. If the industry is truly into a recession, as people like Stifel Analyst Paul Westra believe, then a longish period of sales weakness could cause serious problems for some concepts that have a lot of locations with high lease rates.

That s not the only liability, either. Many franchisees in particular have borrowed tens of millions of dollars to acquire locations and remodel old locations. That debt level could be pushing operators to raise prices even amid declining food costs to meet cash flow covenants.

That debt, too, could look awfully expensive as sales continue to fall.

The decline continued a steady erosion since January 2015 that has worsened in 2016. July marked the third straight monthly decline, the first time that has happened in the post-recession era.

It was also the worst performance since 2010 for the index, excluding February 2013, when the index was compared with a Leap Year month from the year before, said Larry Miller, the survey s co-founder.

 It just got worse again,  Miller said.  There s nothing that says things are stabilizing. 

The index declined because of poor traffic, which fell 2.8 percent for the industry as a whole.

And the index was weak across the board. Same-store sales fell for both quick-service restaurants (0.2 percent) and casual dining (1 percent).

Traffic fell 2.6 percent at quick-service restaurants, and declined 3.1 percent at casual-dining restaurants. Both figures were the worst traffic numbers since MillerPulse began breaking out the two segments in 2012.

 That s just not going to turn,  Miller said.  You have the Olympics going on right now, something that doesn t encourage people to go out of the house. And you have elections, which have divided the country as it normally does. It hurts confidence in the short term until people coalesce around the winning party. 

The dramatic slowdown in industry sales has shocked many observers, given that much of the economy appears to be on solid footing. Gas prices remain low. Unemployment is falling. Wages are rising. Overall inflation appears to be in check. The signs are strong enough that the Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates.

Yet consumers are clearly acting differently this year. Look at retailers: Several brick-and-mortar retail companies have reported disappointing earnings recently. Same-store sales at Minneapolis-based Target Corp. fell 1.1 percent in the second quarter ended July 30, the company said Wednesday.

 When you look at all the retailers, they re not reporting solid numbers,  Miller said.  The consumer is just pulling back, broadly. 

In recent earnings calls, restaurant executives have speculated numerous reasons for the slowdown. Many appear to believe consumers are pulling back broadly and not spending as much as they once did.

Grocery spending might also have something to do with it. Retail food prices decreased 1.6 percent in July, while restaurant menu prices have increased 0.2 percent, according to federal data.

Another potential explanation: The rising number of independent and small chain restaurants not captured by indexes like MillerPulse might be getting more sales.

 Clearly, there is some market share shifting, to grocery and/or independents,  Miller said.  There s a lot of growth out there in units. 

Technology might have something to do with that.

Online ratings through services like OpenTable and Yelp, and on Google, have taken some of the risk out of eating at an independent restaurant. More consumers, looking for different experiences, might be shifting spending in a bid to try something new   much like customers of Target are shifting spending to online retailers like Amazon.

 There s a lot of information about independents on your phone,  Miller said.  Darden [Restaurants] used to say that.  We re trusted. We have a high level of trust with consumers about what they re going to get. 

 Maybe that was the case five to 10 years ago, when people didn t have great information. 

And, he added,  Chains have always had a bad stigma.

 Casual-dining operator looks to double size of portfolio by 2017 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/mergers-acquisitions/real-mex-shops-new-brand","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 19:48:00 +0000","Casual Dining","Real Mex shops for new brandFour years after emerging from bankruptcy, Real Mex Restaurants Inc. is looking for a strategic acquisition with the goal of doubling its portfolio by 2017.

The casual-dining operator has hired Telsey Advisory Group LLC to act as financial advisor in adding a new growth brand to Real Mex, said Bryan Lockwood, CEO of Cypress, Calif.-based Real Mex, on Tuesday. Real Mex is parent to the Acapulco Mexican Restaurants, El Torito Restaurants and Chevys Fresh Mex brands, as well as the four-unit El Torito Grill and one-off concepts Las Brisas, Sinigual, El Paso Cantina, and Who Song and Larry s Cal-Mex Cantina.

Real Mex operates a total of 102 units across those brands, and franchises another 13 Chevys restaurants.

The goal is to leverage Real Mex s infrastructure to grow a new brand, which may not necessarily be a Mexican concept, Lockwood said. It could even be a multi-brand operator.

The target is a company with annual sales between $100 million and $300 million; a concept that appeals to Millennial and Gen Z consumers with global expansion potential; and something in casual dining, fine dining or fast casual.

Lockwood said the company is not interested in a quick-service brand.

 We would virtually be interested in anything except QSR,  he said.  The headwinds will be extraordinary in coming years, so we re not a fan of that space. 

Real Mex is also not looking for a franchise brand, he noted.

 We feel like we have work to do before franchising other brands,  he said.  We need to marinate together a little longer before we ask other people to get involved in what we re doing. 

Real Mex has been setting up a turnaround for the company s core brands since Lockwood was named CEO in March 2015. He said the company s turnaround is well underway.

Despite challenges for the casual-dining segment overall, Real Mex has recorded 12 months of positive same-store sales year over year, Lockwood said, although he declined to give specifics.

Real Mex has revamped or refreshed 22 restaurants, and this month is scheduled to open its first new unit since 2007: a Chevys in Northridge, Calif., that will serve as a new prototype design.

An overhaul of the Acapulco brand debuted with a redesigned restaurant in Downey, Calif., earlier this month. Real Mex has also reworked the menu at the El Torito restaurant near company headquarters.

When Lockwood, the former CEO of Tavistock Restaurants LLC, was hired last year, he was the third CEO of Real Mex in four years.

Real Mex emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 with new private-equity owners Z Capital Partners LLC and Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC.

Earlier this year, Z Capital acquired the two-unit Pink Taco brand, which Real Mex operates under a management service agreement.

Lockwood described the past decade for Real Mex as  tumultuous,  but said the company has stabilized the business and earned the confidence and capital support of its private-equity owners.

Lockwood said Real Mex was once a casual-dining innovator, pioneering features like the frozen margarita and tableside guacamole. But the company  just quit evolving,  he said.

After being hit hard by the recession, it took Real Mex a decade to figure out how to return to relevance, Lockwood said.

About 10 restaurants have closed since Lockwood was hired, mostly because leases ended and the locations no longer seemed viable, he said.

Now the company is focusing on food and putting customers first.

A new culinary team has reworked the menus at each of the core brands to better differentiate the concepts, Lockwood said.

 We quit acting like a big company,  Lockwood said.  Real Mex was this juggernaut. We should be nimble and reactive and be able to listen to our guests and our employees a lot better. 

Acapulco, for example, has moved to a more  beachy  theme, with seafood dishes, and new brunch offerings. The threefold  dumbed down  menu with lots of photos is now a one-page, back-and-front menu, like  what you d expect in a more chef-driven restaurant,  Lockwood said.

Chevys has also added brunch at two restaurants, and 43 of 50 El Torito units now serve brunch.

 Sunday sales are up 19 percent year-to-date, so Sundays have become a very important day for Real Mex,  Lockwood said.

One strength is bar sales. About 28 percent of the mix at Real Mex is from adult beverages, which is about double what is typical in the bar-and-grill sector of casual dining. Lockwood said the company is playing to that strength with the addition of more craft beers and wine, in addition to cocktails.

More work needs to be done, but Lockwood said the timing is right for an acquisition rather than grow existing brands.

 You ve seen proposed public offerings that haven t happened, or there being coolness in the M&A market and the tightening of credit,  he said.  If that doesn t exist today, it s going to exist shortly unless something else happens. And I don t know what that something else would be.

 There are those that like to grow when maybe the waters are a little troubled,  he added.  If you re at the right place at the right time, you can always create opportunity. And that s what we hope to do. 

Correction: Aug. 17, 2016 An earlier version of this story had an incorrect headline that said Real Mex was looking for a buyer. The chain is looking to acquire a new brand.

Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of the Atlanta-based chain, said the operating environment produced softer than expected sales in the second quarter and a reduced same-store sales forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year.

 The headline is we remain in a very value oriented environment, despite a reasonably good situation on gas prices and unemployment,  Bachelder said.  The customer seems less confident in the future than we d like them to be. And so value was very operative in the second quarter, and we re assuming that continues through the year. 

She said the 2,600-unit Popeyes has made adjustments to its third and fourth quarter calendars  to stay on top of that value expectation of our customers,  with an eye on a balance between value offers and new products. During the second quarter Popeyes introduced three limited-time offers (Southern Fair Chicken, Magnolia Blossom Chicken and Boneless Wings) and two one-week promotions   a $5 favorites offer and the boneless wings introduction at a $5 price.

 We do not want to move to a year-round core menu value   we don t think that s healthy for the brand in the long term,  she said,  so balance is our planning principle. 

While acknowledging a strong customer response to these offers   their contribution to the mix of sales in the quarter was the highest ever, Bachelder said   they were not driving incremental sales, which she said was a function of reduced traffic sector-wide.

Bachelder attributed the sector weakness to consumer confidence that was  stable but not robust,  as well as to a  wear-out factor  coming with the increase in value promotions. Finally, she said decreasing grocery prices were reducing eating out overall.

 I feel comfortable that our franchises are doing their best to stay competitive in their marketplace. What I'm not satisfied with this the sector trends,  she said.  I think the sector needs to improve. The consumer needs to be eating out more often in general for all of us to prosper. So, I think we're okay on pricing but I'd sure like to see more vitality in the sector on traffic.

Marcato Capital Management, which owns 5.2 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings stock, released a lengthy presentation on its ideas for Buffalo Wild Wings, along with a scathing, four-page letter that called for  the introduction of fresh talent  on the company s board and management.

The letter comes a day after what Mick McGuire, Marcato CEO, called the company s  lackluster analyst day presentation  and amid  observable discontent among shareholders and research analysts. 

 Buffalo Wild Wings must make substantial changes to its business practices if it hopes to reach its full potential both as a company and in terms of shareholder value,  McGuire wrote.

In a statement, Buffalo Wild Wings said it has reviewed the presentation, and would review McGuire s letter. The company also said it and outside advisors have spoken with the activist  numerous times  since learning of its investment.

  

  The Buffalo Wild Wings Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company and all of its shareholders,  the company said in a statement.

Buffalo Wild Wings  stock fell nearly 16 percent this year before July, when Marcato revealed its position in the company and its stock subsequently skyrocketed. The chain s same-store sales, which had been slowing in 2015, fell into negative territory this year. Same-store sales fell 2.1 percent at company-owned locations in the second quarter ended June 26.

During the Analyst Day presentation, the company said it planned to increase the number of share buybacks, and could start paying a dividend, while borrowing more money.

But it also defended its current strategy of acquiring franchised locations and operating more company-owned units. Buffalo Wild Wings operates nearly half of the system s nearly 1,200 locations.

 We still think that a well-operated company restaurant can create significantly more profit than franchising,  James Schmidt, Buffalo Wild Wings chief operating officer, said during the analyst presentation.

 

 But Marcato says that strategy should end, and the company should sell most of its more than 500 locations to new and existing franchisees. The activist says Buffalo Wild Wings would earn a higher earnings multiple from investors if it shifted to a 90-percent franchised model. That would require selling approximately 400 company-owned locations.

The firm noted that, in general, companies with a higher percentage of franchised units are trading at higher multiples than companies with a higher percentage of company-owned units.

Marcato also took issue with Buffalo Wild Wings  continued acquisition of franchisees   and especially with the purchase of the 41-unit Alamowing Development LLC for $160 million last year. McGuire called the acquisition an  unmitigated disaster,  and called for an assessment of the purchase.

 That such an obviously misguided decision could be made under the guise of rigorous analysis underscores the weakness in the company s capital allocation processes and need to commit to a disciplined capital allocation plan,  McGuire wrote.

Marcato says that Buffalo Wild Wings should focus on  operational excellence  within its core business.

 Efforts to drive growth primarily through new unit openings and franchisee acquisitions currently take unwarranted precedence over maximizing same-store sales and restaurant-level margin opportunities at core Buffalo Wild Wings,  McGuire wrote.  Over the long-term, neither system growth nor franchisee acquisitions will be able to compensate for a decline in the profitability of the core concept. 

In the letter, McGuire noted the  cessation of emerging brands  growth plans,  saying that the company should focus solely on its core business.  Buffalo Wild Wings  continued success is not an inevitability,  he wrote.  As such, we believe the company should remain singularly focused on its largest earnings driver rather than placing wild bets, however small, on hit or miss growth drivers. 

In recent years, Buffalo Wild Wings acquired majority ownership in the fast-casual Mexican chain R Taco and invested in the fast-casual pizza chain PizzaRev. During the analyst day, the company again argued that the chains could provide growth in the future.

 We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to be forward looking,  Buffalo Wild Wings CEO Sally Smith said.  If we find a concept that has the potential to become a success story, we know how to build restaurants. We know how to build a brand. And we have franchisees that want to expand. 

McGuire called for the addition of talent to the board and management.  No current director has direct restaurant operating experience outside the CEO,  he said.

 We would also stress that any changes to the board should only be made after consultation with interested shareholders, and we would view any unilateral action to change the composition of the board as a hostile act of entrenchment,  he wrote.

That line could signal Marcato s willingness to start a proxy fight if it s not consulted on any potential new board members.

McGuire called on Buffalo Wild Wings to increase  urgency  in efforts to improve the brand.

 A review of past years  earnings reports reveals a number of company priorities that have since dragged on without meaningful progress,  notably the  bungled rollout of table-side order and pay functionality,  he wrote.  Even now, management is content to highlight the opportunity while very little tangible progress has been achieved. 

Update: Aug. 17, 2016  This story has been updated with a statement from Buffalo Wild Wings. A correction was also made to reflect the correct name of the chain's CEO; it is Sally Smith.

Harper, most recently human resources director for The Wendy s Co. U.S. operations, joined the Cincinnati-based Frisch s Big Boy company in July.

Frisch s also said it had hired Anne Mejia as executive vice president of marketing and promoted Steve Hansen to executive vice president of its commissary.

 Having Anne, Steve and Sheri on our executive team is a huge win for Frisch s moving forward,  said Jason Vaughn, who was named Frisch s CEO in April, in a statement.  All of these leaders have extensive restaurant experience and will be extremely valuable assets as we take this brand to the next level. 

Harper most recently served as human resources director for 6,000 U.S.-operated Wendy s restaurants and provided consulting services to all domestic Wendy s franchise owners.

 Frisch s cultivates a heritage of being an employer of choice,  Harper said in a statement.  As we usher the brand and the restaurants into an updated look and feel, we will continue to celebrate one of the biggest reasons for our success: our staff and company culture. 

Mejia most recently was vice president of marketing at ServiceMaster Franchise Services Group. She has worked with restaurant brands including McCormick & Schmick s, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Jack in the Box and Carl s Jr. Mejia led the recent redesign of the Big Boy logo and helped create a contemporary new look for a Frisch s restaurant in Covington, Ky.

Hansen has been with Frisch s for six years. In his new role, he will lead efforts to transition Frisch s commissary to its own business entity, the company said.

Frisch s Restaurants Inc. owns and operates 95 Big Boy restaurants in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, and franchises another 25 units. The company is owned by NRD Capital, based in Atlanta, which acquired the operator in 2015.

"Tackling the Tea Opportunity"," Foodservice operators find new profitability center in merchandising quality teas. 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/beverage-trends/tackling-tea-opportunity","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 12:00:00 +0000","Beverage Trends","Tackling the Tea OpportunityIn a growing number of restaurants, iced tea has evolved from a commodity into a highly profitable signature item. It is offered in a variety of styles, ranging from exotic flavored refreshers to stylish cocktails and mocktails to frothy nitro tea on tap. Along with hot tea, it is a cornerstone of beverage profitability and increasingly a consumer favorite.

In fact, specialty iced tea, including Thai-style, Southern/sweet, flavored and matcha tea, was the third hottest nonalcoholic beverage in the National Restaurant Association s 2016 What s Hot Culinary Forecast. And a Packaged Facts report this year pegged tea as a $20 billion market in foodservice and predicted that it would have the edge on coffee in growth momentum through 2018 and beyond.

Thus it s high time for restaurant operators to upgrade their tea, according to Scott Svihula, owner of Hula Consulting, an Orlando, Fla.-based tea and coffee consultancy. The first step is using high quality tea. Flavor is a key driver of iced tea sales, and the profit margin of tea is so inherently large that the cost difference between so-so and great tasting tea is negligible.

For example, an operator who pays $30 per case for tea runs a cost of about 5 cents per 16-ounce glass, Svihula says. But upgrading to an $80-per-case tea, which is more flavorful and will sell more glasses, raises the cost to only 8 or 9 cents per serving. Priced at a typical $2.50 to $2.90 per glass, the upgraded brew still has a gross profit percentage in the high 90s.

 There is not another menu item that you can improve upon so much without affecting your gross profit,  says Svihula. And the profit climbs even higher when tea is leveraged in cocktails and alcohol-free mocktails, he adds.

Having tackled the iced tea opportunity, the next step for many operators is improving the tea used for brewing hot tea by the cup and by the pot, another upgrade that pays off in higher profits, Svihula says.

Some establishments go to great lengths to make tea a standout experience. For example, The Commons Club lounge at Virgin Hotels Chicago sports a list of more than a dozen fine and rare teas representing black, green, oolong, white, pu-erh and herbal styles. They range from an organically grown English Breakfast priced at $7 per pot to a 1982 cave-aged pu-erh with a $55 price tag.

 We definitely sell more tea than the average restaurant,  says Jon Harris, Virgin Hotels Chicago bar manager.

Not unlike a good wine list, The Commons Club tea list includes tasting notes. Emperor s Dragonwell, an organic Chinese green tea, is described as nutty with nuances of honey and pine, high in antioxidants and low in caffeine. Listing the relative caffeine level of various teas is important to some tea drinkers.

 At times, people are looking to wind down with tea, but other times they want a pick-me-up,  says Harris.  I definitely think it informs peoples  decisions. 

At The Cafe at LeFlour in Chicago, nitro chai tea on tap is the brand new sensation for tea drinkers, priced at $3.95 for a 10-ounce glass.

 The tea looks like a light beer,  says Kristen Polich, co-owner of The Cafe.    You let it sit in the glass for 30 seconds or so and watch it cascade and slowly rise. It ends up with a little foam on top like the head on a beer. 

She has been selling the nitro chai tea along with nitro coffee for about two weeks. Each product is prepared and kegged by a local coffee roaster and propelled through the tap by a nitrogen gas system. When the nitro chai, which is made with black tea and masala spices, runs its course, The Cafe will tap a peach punch and black tea blend, Polich says.

So far, The Cafe is selling five to 10 glasses of nitro chai tea per day on average. But Polich expects more.  I think it is just a matter of getting the word out that this is the next thing and that you can get it with nitro,  says Polich.  We wanted to get in on it before it became mainstream.

Domestic same-store sales were flat for the July 10-ended quarter, compared with a 7.9-percent increase a year ago.

But the Atlanta-based operator said it continued to grow its market share within the quick-service chicken segment to a record high of 26.6 percent.

As a result, Popeyes downgraded its same-store sales estimate for the year, projecting growth of 1 percent to 2 percent, a decrease from previous guidance of 2 percent to 3 percent.

Cheryl Bachelder, Popeyes CEO, said slower sales were consistent with the sector.

 We remain highly confident that our bold, long-term goals are achievable,  Bachelder said.

Popeyes has implemented new field visit protocols to advance operational improvements, and is investing in new technologies, she said.

Net income was $10.3 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with $10.3 million, or 44 cents per share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter increased 3.9 percent, to $61.7 million.

The chain ended the quarter with 2,594 company-operated and franchised restaurants.

For the year, 200 to 235 restaurants new openings are expected, including 85 to 100 international locations.

But as the Minneapolis-based chicken-wing chain fills out its market in the U.S., and as same-store sales that once consistently rose stumble this year, the company is looking toward new avenues.

Specifically, Buffalo Wild Wings is targeting urban areas to reach younger consumers moving away from the suburbs, and rural areas where its sports bars haven t reached yet.

In addition, the company is looking at international markets, where it has relatively few locations, but where its potential is far greater than in the U.S.

 International franchising will someday be a bigger part of our growth strategy than domestic Buffalo Wild Wings,  CEO Sally Smith told analysts during the company s Analyst Day presentation Tuesday in Denver.

The presentation comes at a critical juncture for Buffalo Wild Wings. Same-store sales, which had been rising for years, even as casual-dining competitors struggled, have fallen for two straight quarters. That includes a 2.1-percent decline at company-owned restaurants in the second quarter ended June 26.

Investors have started to put pressure on the chain, too. Last month, the activist investor Marcato Capital Management revealed that it had taken a position in the company. That has since helped generate enthusiasm for Buffalo Wild Wings stock, as investors anticipated major changes at the company   its stock rose more than 26 percent at one point in the days after Marcato s filing.

But investors didn t get all they wanted from Buffalo Wild Wings on Tuesday   the company s stock fell more than 2 percent. Buffalo Wild Wings did announce plans to borrow more money and buy back another $300 million in its own stock in a bid to drive up the share price. That comes on top of $75 million already remaining in a previously approved $200 million share buyback.

Executives also said Tuesday that they would explore paying dividends to investors.

 Our stores are generating cash flow beyond what s required for growth,  Smith said.

Still, Buffalo Wild Wings  presentation didn t include any major changes in the brand or its strategy from before Marcato took its position.

Buffalo Wild Wings operates nearly half of its 1,179 locations in the U.S. and Canada. The company has been strategically buying out franchisees over the years when such acquisitions could provide it with a return. And executives hinted that strategy would continue.

 We still think that a well-operated company restaurant can create significantly more profit than franchising,  James Schmidt, chief operating officer of Buffalo Wild Wings, said during the analyst presentation.

The company is also optimistic that it can continue to develop new locations in the U.S., despite concerns of overall market saturation among casual-dining concepts, as well as Buffalo Wild Wings  own recent slowdown.

Buffalo Wild Wings says it can develop another 500 locations in the U.S. and Canada. But the company is slightly shifting from a more suburban model to one in more small towns and urban areas, Schmidt said.

Urban areas can satisfy younger consumers, as well as Baby Boomers who are moving back into cities.

Smaller cities require a smaller box. Buffalo Wild Wings is looking at cities with populations under 50,000 people, where it would build units of 4,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet, rather than the typical 5,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet.

The smaller restaurants cost $1.8 million to open, instead of $2.3 million, but have fewer seats   200 instead of 240   and lower unit volumes of $2.4 million, instead of $3.2 million.

Buffalo Wild Wings is also working extensively on its  Stadia  remodeling program. The company expects to spend $40 million to $45 million a year for the next five years to remodel 60 to 70 company-owned locations annually. Franchisees also expect to remodel locations.

Executives said that the remodel generates 5 percent in additional sales.

The company highlighted areas that it hopes will reverse the same-store sales slip. Buffalo Wild Wings is pushing its lunch daypart, including a 15-minute guarantee, and is also promoting a Wing Tuesdays campaign offering half-price wings.

Buffalo Wild Wings also hopes delivery can ultimately drive sales, while online ordering and to-go business can compete with takeout chains that are stealing some of its sales. The company is testing delivery in two markets, and says its wings would satisfy consumer demand.

Technology, meanwhile, could also be part of the equation. Servers use handheld devices in high-volume restaurants, in some high-cost markets, to reduce labor costs. The company is also exploring menu ordering and payment from the table.

The technology  will drive efficiencies and keep labor flat while labor costs are rising,  Smith said.

Buffalo Wild Wings also affirmed its commitment to growth concepts. The company owns a majority position in the taco concept R Taco, and a minority position in the fast-casual pizza chain PizzaRev.

 We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to be forward-looking,  Smith said.  If we find a concept that has the potential to become a success story, we know how to build restaurants. We know how to build a brand. And we have franchisees that want to expand. 

The two brands  are currently a very small part of our business. But there s strong potential for future growth.

Wetzel s Pretzels, the innovator in the fresh-baked pretzel category, today unveiled its all-new Wetzel s Pretzels Rewards Mobile App, which allows guest to earn free pretzels, pay with their mobile phone and send virtual gift cards to friends.

Designed and built by Relevant Mobile, a trailblazer in developing customized mobile apps and mobile-centric data-capturing solutions exclusively for the restaurant industry, the new app is now available for download by Android and iOS users for all domestic Wetzel s locations.

 We like to do things a little twisted here at Wetzel s, so we wanted our Rewards app to be different than everyone else s   and thanks to the team at Relevant Mobile, we did it,  said Jennifer Schuler, Chief Marketing Officer at Wetzel s Pretzels.  Most brands in our space allow guests to earn points based on the number of visits or dollars spent, but we wanted to create a loyalty program that rewards our guests for every pretzel item they buy. That, coupled with the ability to send digital gift cards to friends, is in keeping with the unique personality of our brand. 

The Wetzel s Rewards program is unique in that it is item-based, going beyond the typical punch card or visit-based experience. Guests earn credit for every pretzel item they purchase   whether pretzels, bitz or Wetzel Dogs. Each time a pretzel item is purchased, the guest scans his or her mobile phone at the register and receives a dot on the Rewards meter. For every six pretzel items purchased, the meter is filled and a reward is earned.

The app likewise includes a Virtual Gift Card feature that allows users to select a card design, enter a recipient s name and email address along with the gift amount, and finalize payment all through the mobile application.

Guests can also use the app to pay at the register using their mobile phone, find their nearest Wetzel s location, view their Rewards activity history, refer friends, get technical support and find answers to FAQs.

 Our team really enjoyed working with the Wetzel s Pretzels brand,  Dazhi Chen, Founder at Relevant Mobile.  They have a lot of personality and they re very playful, which allowed us to have some fun creating their app. They re a really exciting addition to the Relevant family and we look forward to seeing how their guests use the new app to bond more closely with the brand.

As word spread about these golden-on-the-outside pretzels, the company added additional offerings to its menu. Today, Wetzel s Pretzels has grown to more than 300 fresh bakeries across the United States and around the world, including premier locations at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort. Every Wetzel s Pretzels bakery adheres to the original vision of its founders; that each super-premium pretzel will be crafted from fresh dough and baked in-store consistently throughout the day, to ensure a delicious offering for each consumer, regardless of when the craving for a pretzel strikes.

Staying engaged with your community and being open to communication is one way to attract new customers. Social media can have a huge reach, and it can introduce you to many new people.

Nothing brings in new customers like the recommendations of their family, friends, and coworkers. One of the best ways you can attract new diners is by keeping your current diners happy. When they brag to everyone about the awesome experience they had at your bar or restaurant, everyone who listens in will be that much more likely to check you out. Best of all? Word of mouth is totally free.

Be sure to scan your Yelp reviews (and other review sites, too). Remember, this is what potential customers will see when they look you up. If there s a lot of negative feedback, work on correcting your faults. Hopefully by fixing your problem areas, you can make your restaurant a lot more attractive to new customers. And by responding to complaints, you ll show potential customers that you care about your customer service.

Daily deal sites like Groupon and Living Social are a bit controversial. There s some debate about whether or not they work, and using them too often can devalue your brand. But if you re looking to get the word out about your restaurant and entice new customers, it might be a good idea to try out a daily deal site once.

Many customers aren t willing to take a chance with a new restaurant, but if you can offer them a deal, they might be more likely to try something new. Try using coupons that offer deals for first time customers.

Although getting new customers to walk through your doors might seem difficult, it s definitely not impossible. Try out a few of these tips and see if you can bring in more first time customers!

 Restaurants are the beloved cornerstones of communities across America,  said Dawn Sweeney, President and CEO of the National Restaurant Association.  America s one million restaurants provide opportunity to 14 million Americans and have become an essential part of our everyday lives. 

According to National Restaurant Association research nine in ten consumers say they enjoy going to restaurants and two in five consumers say restaurants are an essential part of their lifestyle. One half of all adults have worked in the restaurant industry at some point during their lives and one third of all Americans got their first job working in a restaurant.

As the nation s second largest private sector employer, restaurants continue to be economic drivers, employing nearly 10 percent of America s workforce.

In addition, more than nine out of 10 restaurants are actively involved in charitable activities. Collectively, the charitable contributions of the nation s one million restaurants are estimated to reach up to $3 billion each year.

Gallup asks Americans to rate industries on a scale from  very positive  to  very negative.  The computer industry is second to restaurants. Gallup stated that the restaurant industry continuously scores so highly because they offer Americans  enjoyment and efficiency. ","Restaurants and Food Services"

On Friday, September 2, at 11am, a brick-and-mortar storefront of the popular food cart will open their doors at the Springfield Tower Shopping Center (6304 Springfield Plaza.)  The first 100 guests in line will receive a free entree platter of their choice and the first 1000 guests in line will have their choice of The Halal Guys t-shirt, sunglasses or commemorative cup.

 The Halal Guys was  love at first bite  for us,  said Operating Franchisee.   We are looking forward to bringing THG gyro sandwiches, chicken-and-rice platters and famous white sauce to the NoVA community and anticipate the grand opening being a huge success. 

The fast casual concept, known for its never-ending lines and a simple menu of various Middle Eastern dishes, has already been well received in Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Northern and Southern California. They pride themselves on only using high-quality products like their chicken, which has never been frozen and is marinated and seasoned overnight, then cooked and chopped on the grill and served directly to their plate to ensure a crave worthy meal that s piping hot. The Halal Guys  mission is to ensure that every customer leaves happy, with a smile on their face and a satisfaction that brings them back again.

The Halal Guys grew from its humble beginnings as a food cart on the streets of New York City to a global icon known as the largest American halal street food concept in the world. This Manhattan-based landmark was created by three like-minded men from Egypt who came to America in search of a lucrative life. When Mohamed Abouelenein, Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed noticed that many cab drivers in New York were looking for a place to buy meals in Manhattan, they created their first food cart and quickly grew into a leading tourist and native New Yorker destination for American Halal fare. In 2013, The Halal Guys were ranked the most popular food truck reviewed on FourSquare and the third most Yelped restaurant in the United States in 2014.

For updates on the Springfield location follow them on Facebook & Instagram.

The Halal Guys aim to be different and encourage patrons across America to ditch burgers for something unique. Among being awarded the 2014 Multicultural Award at The 5th American Muslim Consumer Conference, The Halal Guys have also been recognized by TIME Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, The New York Times and The Huffington Post.

Brews

It s hard to imagine a more fitting Southern cuisine than slow-smoked barbecue.  In homage to their Georgian roots, this beloved Southern staple is also the inspiration behind Your Pie s latest creation in the brand s seasonal Craft Pie Series. This fall, the down-the-line brick oven pizza franchise is bringing the family BBQ experience to their stores with the new Pitmaster Pie. The series will be offered for a limited time at all Your Pie locations from August 17th through October 25th.



 Your Pie is all about craft, and for this launch, we re excited to continue on with our tradition of innovation, both in the flavors of specialty pizza and gelato and having the opportunity to partner with another incredible brewery,  said Drew French, founder of Your Pie.  The Southern influences of true American barbecue are a favorite taste among many Americans. We were inspired to incorporate that irresistible smoky flavor into a specialty pizza. Paired with all of the flavors that make barbecue great, it really creates the bold tastes only found in a backyard barbecue but on a pizza. 

The new Pitmaster Pizza features smoky pulled pork and fire-roasted balsamic onions topped off with house-made coleslaw, tangy BBQ sauce and a zesty ranch drizzle. Your Pie is pairing this new menu item with featured brews from Terrapin Beer Co. Founded in 2002 in Athens, Georgia, Terrapin features year-round beers like the Rye Pale Ale and Hopsecutioner IPA. Other seasonal additions to the Craft Pie Series menu include the Banana Pudding Gelato a sweet compliment to the kick of the Pitmaster Pie. Made with ripened bananas and laced with a delicate cinnamon rum ripple, the Banana Pudding Gelato is the perfect mashup of Southern classic and Italian tradition.

The Craft Pie Series has been a seasonal feature of the Your Pie menu since French opened the first fast-casual pizza concept in 2008. Since then, they ve whipped up popular creations like the Slider Pie, a pizza spin on the classic American cheeseburger; the Peach Prosciutto Pizza, which featured fresh peaches, prosciutto and a honey balsamic glaze; and the Fresh Fiesta Pie a deconstructed take on guacamole.

With the launch of the new Pitmaster Pie, Your Pie will continue to encourage every store to partner up with a local charity of their choice as part of the Ins pie ering communities efforts. To make a positive impact on local communities, a portion of craft series profits will be donated back to a local charity.

 We re excited to continue our  InsPIEring Communities  concept as a compliment to not only this event, but to many of the values central to Your Pie as a whole,  said French.  Franchisees in individual markets will each be partnering with an organization of their choice to donate pizzas and proceeds raised through any Pitmaster Pie sales. 

Visit www.yourpie.com to find the nearest Your Pie location or for franchising information.

Your Pie is the world s originator of the quick-serve, brick-oven, customized personal pizza category. A culinary entrepreneur since his teenage years, Your Pie founder Drew French combined his passion for innovative restaurant concepts with brick oven technology to create the highest quality pizza available at incredible speed. Drawing from family recipes from the island of Ischia, Your Pie uses hand-tossed dough, only fresh ingredients, homemade pizza sauces and salad dressings, and offers vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free pizzas, as well as traditional pizzas.

Bad vibes, not higher pay, may be the biggest impact of the new Obama administration overtime rule, set to take effect Dec. 1.

In a second-quarter earnings call with analysts, CEO Dan Accordino of Carrols Restaurant Group, whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International chain s largest franchisee, said that his company is  putting all of our salaried managers on an hourly basis. 

Carrols anticipates no effect on the bottom line:  It will not cost   I mean we re not going to change the compensation of the managers,  Accordino said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.  We re simply taking (a) 50-hour work week or 55-hour work week   and converting their current salaries into an hourly rate, assuming the overtime. ","Restaurants and Food Services"

The campaign revolves around a core of three dramatic  Spoken Cinema  pieces performed by artist Steve Connell that focus on Sustainability, Quality and Family.

 The conversations about food in America have changed rapidly,  said Marilyn Nicholson, Vice President Marketing, Media, & Promotions for Long John Silver s.  The format of these pieces in combination with a robust digital deployment will allow us to tell our brand story in a different way and engage a broader audience with more substantive content. We re hoping to reach that audience with a depth of content that traditional QSR advertising limits. 

The campaign will launch on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and edited Vines with paid flights running into the Fall. All content will be linked to the www.ljsilvers.com flagship website and to unique microsite links for each piece, starting with www.sustainabilityljs.com. The campaign will also be supported by email and in store signage. Budget details of the campaign were not released but the company estimated it would reach millions of consumers with its initial push.

First to launch of the trio will be a piece on Sustainability. Long John Silver s primary products are 100 percent wild-caught Alaskan Cod and Pollock from the best-managed fishery in the world. The waters of the Northern Pacific and stocks of Cod and Pollock are continually monitored and fishing quotas adjusted to protect the strength of the species. Shot on location in and off the shores of Alaska, the piece portrays the beauty and drama of the pristine waters from which the fish are caught.

The second in the series is a piece about Food and Quality underscoring the fact that nourishment is bigger than appetite.  The third in the series is about Family and Food which celebrates the meaning of sharing a meal together and that many people are part of the Long John Silver s family, the fisherman, farmers, owners, and crews who are engaged in bringing quality products to customers. All three spoken cinema pieces can be viewed and shared on YouTube, ljsilvers.com, Facebook, and Twitter.

Spoken Cinema is a new experiential platform that communicates through spoken word, an original score and dynamic visuals. Spoken Cinema is a trademark of Nashville-based GoWest Creative (www.gowestcreativegroup.com), the agency that created the Long John Silver s work. The videos feature artist Steve Connell (www.steveconnellcreates.com). Cincinnati-based Marsh Brand Partners (www.marshideas.com) supported the digital roll-out of the Spoken Cinema work.

Long John Silver s is a classic American brand founded in 1969, and stands today as the nation s largest quick-service seafood chain with more than 1,000 restaurants in the U.S. Long John Silver s is famous for its pure, wild-caught Alaskan whitefish hand-dipped in our signature batter and lightly fried to golden perfection.

"What s in your (digital) wallet?","              This blog is based on the report  Mobile Payments in the U.S.  View the abstract and table of contents   here  .  
  Aug. 10 -  Take a peek at your wallet or purse and what do you see? A little cash? A driver s license? Employee ID and insurance cards? Some lint? And, of course, a nice mix of payment cards? 
 For a card issuer, it all comes down to where their card stands in your wallet: is it your primary card, the one that sits at the top of your wallet the one you grab the most when paying? For many issuers, that s the catbird seat. You don t have to be first to be a winner though, especially if you are a private label card issuer with hopes of driving sales to a specific merchant, where third place isn t just a ribbon to toss in a drawer; or even a cobrand card issuer, where second can feel downright wonderful. 
 Even if a wallet can hold seven or eight cards, some of them can become out of sight, out of mind, hidden beneath the insurance card, never to be used again. A sad day indeed for that card. Meanwhile, mini-wallets today hold just two or three cards giving users reason to bring along only those cards that make the first cut. 
 In theory, digital wallets promise a bigger wallet one that can hold all of your cards, including loyalty and gifts cards (the ones we otherwise so easily lose they never even get into that old-school leather wallet!). This is a boon for consumers, who now can actually manage and manage not to lose all of their cards using them when and where they see fit. And it means all cards get a place in the wallet, a boon for the has-beens and the forgotten. 
 But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies. 
  Cause for concern  
 But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results: 
  Some 48% of adult smartphone users who have used their phone to make a payment at the point of sale in the past 12 months say that they carry fewer cards than they used to carry a result of using mobile payments. 
  And the tendency to carry fewer cards to make payments is higher among Millennials, already a credit card usage trouble spot. 
   Cards are getting winnowed out . Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet. 
 This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:  
  Instead of loading  all  of their cards, are mobile POS payers just loading the ones they really need? 
  Are they defaulting to the card originally uploaded as a part of a corresponding user account (in Apple Pay, for example, do they just use the card originally entered in iTunes)? 
 How do credit card rewards/points factor into using credit cards in digital wallets? 
 Could merchants tie rewards to ACH debit? 
  Packaged Facts     Mobile Payments in the U.S.    wades further into this issue.

But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies.

But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results:

Cards are getting winnowed out. Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet.

This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:

"Growth in meat snack sales is not for all products","              Packaged Facts is offering a healthy discount on   Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition  . Purchase the report by October 1 and receive 10% off with code  SNACKS2016 .  
  Aug. 2 -  Meat snacks (jerky and other snacks such as meat sticks) have become a darling of the snacking world in the last couple of years. Between paleo dieters and CrossFitters espousing the benefits of a high protein diet, the gluten- and wheat-free tribes avoiding anything to do with breads, and the continued negative press that carbs have been receiving, meat has come galloping to the rescue for many different types of snackers. 
 However, this has also caused a shift in the style of meat snacks gaining popularity, which is away from traditional simple varieties of beef jerky and towards more complex meat snacks that make use of alternative proteins (i.e., bison, kangaroo, salmon) and unique flavors, marketing artisanal meat snacks that are worlds away from your grandfather s jerky, notes Packaged Facts in the report    Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition   . 
 So how is this shift affecting sales for different meat snack providers? Link Snacks is the largest meat snack producer in the U.S., but is also having the roughest go of it trying to stay relevant in this new snacking world. Dollar sales for the company over the past year were down 7% while volume sales were down 15%, which shows the company has tried to stave off larger losses by increasing prices. If any meat snack brand epitomizes the classic style of jerky, it is Jack Link s, and these sales results show that this is not the kind of jerky people are looking for any more. 
 Compare these results to Krave s, a brand that epitomizes the new wave of healthier-for-you meat snacks marketed directly towards Millennials and which feature unique ingredients. The company ranked among the top eight marketers of meat snacks over the past year in terms of dollar sales. Dollar sales for the company were up 71%, with volume sales up 84%. These results suggest the company is selling more of its 3.5 oz bags of jerky as well as the even larger bags it sells online, but anyway you slice it, growth of the brand has been phenomenal. Oberto Sausage has also seen really good growth in dollar sales through the introduction of its new All Natural Oberto Jerky brand. The lower unit sales growth and much lower volume sales growth suggests the company has positioned this jerky as a premium brand, with a higher price point compared to its Oh Boy! brand. 
 However, let s be clear; it is really only Link Snacks and private label meat snacks that are having a hard time growing sales in this fast-growing category. Other traditional meat snacks manufacturers are doing just fine. ConAgra Foods saw strong growth in sales of its classic Slim Jim meat sticks over the period, although it is clear that about half of that growth came through price increases. Bridgford Foods is also doing exceptionally well with its Sweet Baby Ray jerkies, which pair Bridgford Foods  jerkies with the well-known BBQ sauce brand. The company actually saw a 37% increase in unit sales over the period, higher than the dollar sales growth, but slightly lower volume sales growth, suggesting the company reduced unit sizes over the period. 
 Clearly, Link Snacks needs to get itself sorted in this new market, and the company s recent introduction of its Small Batch and Lorissa s Kitchen brands are a step in this direction. However, its doubtful Krave, Bridgford Foods, and the other marketers are going to calmly wait for the venerable jerky marketer to catch up.

  July 18 -  Generally speaking, consumers express interest in new culinary experiences; however, some trepidation remains when it comes to actually  trying  different foods from other cultures. Through innovation, Asian noodle marketers can help bridge the gap between interest and trial, according to Packaged Facts in the report    Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities   . 
 As suggested by our survey results, those who eat Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. The willingness to explore new food options skews higher among those who eat Asian noodles at a restaurant. 
 Once again, this reinforces the idea that restaurants are often a point of entry in ethnic food exploration. So it s not surprising to find that Asian noodle users tend to strongly agree that they enjoy eating foreign foods at a restaurant and often try different foods from other cultures. 
 Some degree of food adventurousness is required to gain knowledge and experience, which can then prompt continued food exploration. 
  As suggested by our survey results, those who believe they possess a strong knowledge of Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. This implies that the willingness to explore new food options and culinary experiences leads to increased confidence and knowledge in other cuisines. 
 Conversely, those who claim they have no Asian noodle knowledge are also less adventurous when it comes to trying new foods/recipes or showing interest in other cultures and foreign foods. 
  To better attract those who are less willing to experiment in food and culture, providing customized options allowing guests to select familiar ingredients will likely have the best opportunity as a point of entry for these new users.  
 Consider the expanding noodle chain Wagamama, which frames its brand as presenting staple modern Asian cuisine delivering fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. The company leverages authenticity while understanding menu explanation is important to help guests feel comfortable with its brand and menu. For example, Teppanyaki is a menu section that offers this explanation to help patrons to increase noodle knowledge and encourage trial:  Teppanyaki is a big plate of sizzling noodles, stir-fried by quickly turning them on a flat griddle. This means you get soft noodles and crunchy vegetables.  
  The bottom line  
 By leveraging limited-time offers, seasonal menus, and other menu strategies that play to variety and change, restaurants play a significant role in shaping society s comfort with trying the new and different when it comes to foreign/ethnic foods. 
 For packaged food marketers, noodle opportunity involves utilizing brand extension, cobranding partnerships and premiumization to gain traction and encourage consumers to explore this type of culinary innovation at home.

"Millennials: Unbanked but bankable?","              Packaged Facts is your trusted source for market research on the financial services industry. We cover topics ranging from financial services for small businesses to debit &amp; credit cards to mobile payments. See our full catalog of related reports  here .   
  June 27 -  Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts    Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers   report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships. 
 Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons. 
 However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century. 
   Many Millennials fit this description .   
 Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models. 
 But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it: 
  In 2008, some 20% of unbanked 18-34s had nevertheless used a bank, a credit union or a savings &amp; loan institution in the past 12 months for some other kind of product or service. 
 In 2015, the percentage of unbanked 18-34s using these financial institutions for something else had risen to 37.5%.  
  These activities could range from obtaining major loans to picking up a prepaid card, getting a money order or cashing in coins. The bottom line is that the theory that Millennials are abandoning banks may be significantly overblown: By one measure, traditional financial institutions are clearly bleeding younger checking and savings accountholders, but by another much broader measure, usage is on the rebound. 
 The question is whether that usage translates to major-ticket revenue in the form of major loans or investment vehicles, steady, incremental revenue in the form of credit cards and prepaid cards, or some other source or merely an occasional piggyback on branch convenience for minor products or services.

"Millennials get ready to bring up fur baby","              See more Packaged Facts reports focused on Millennials  here .  
  June 20 -  The Millennial generation has become a driving force in the American pet industry.  Between 2007 and 2015, Millennials were responsible for 43% of the growth in the number of pet owners in the United States.  The 43 million pet owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group now account for around one in three pet owners, according to Packaged Facts in the report   Millennials as Pet Market Consumers .  
 Millennial consumers will play an even more significant role in the pet industry over the next decade.  The accelerating aging of the American population threatens to shift the consumer landscape for the pet industry because pet ownership traditionally has declined precipitously after the age of 60.  Although aging Boomers will still account for the largest share of growth in the population of pet owners, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in the market for pet products and services.  According to Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data, more than four in 10 (44%) Millennials don t have a pet now but hope to have one in the future.  Packaged Facts projects that the Millennial generation will be responsible for adding 2.6 million pet owners between 2015 and 2020.  
 Packaged Facts    Millennials as Pet Market Consumers   provides important insights for marketers trying to understand the mindset of 18- to 34-year-old pet owners.  For one thing, Millennial pet owners demonstrate an overwhelming urge to pamper their pets.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, they are much more likely than other pet owners to agree  I would rather spend money on pet toys and other products for my pets than on things for myself.   Millennials also are much more likely to  splurge  once in a while on an item for their pets and to enjoy purchasing products that pamper their pets.   So it is not surprising that Simmons National Consumer Study data show that both dog and cat owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are much more likely than other pet owners to buy toys and fashion accessories for their pets. 
 Millennials want pets they can pick up and carry wherever they go.  Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data show that 18- to 34-year-olds are much more likely to prefer to have a small pet  you can take with you more places.   Thus, dog owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are more likely than other dog owners to have small dogs weighing less than 25 pounds and much less likely to have dogs weighing over 40 pounds. 
 Millennials are more likely to coddle their pets when they feed them.  Around 30% of Millennial dog or cat owners prepare home-cooked meals for their pets, compared to just 19% of dog owners and 10% of cat owners in the 35- and-over age group.  Millennial dog or cat owners are more likely to prepare side dishes to add interest and nutrition to pre-made pet food.  Millennials also spend more money than other pet owners on treats and chews for their dogs or cats, suggesting that they especially like to reward their pets with treats and chews. 
 Millennials also appear to be a bit more obsessive about the health and safety of their pets.  For example, Millennial dog or cat owners express an elevated concern about the possibility of feeding their pets contaminated foods.  Besides being more involved in providing home-cooked foods for their pets, they are much more likely than other pet owners to use raw pet food or pet foods with formulations geared toward enhancing the health of their pets, such as organic, natural or non-GMO. 
 Moreover, compared to their older counterparts, 18- to 34-year-old pet owners are more fixated on keeping an eye on their pets.  They are much more likely to employ a wide range of technologies to track the activities of their pets and monitor the status of their health, including webcams, smartphone or tablet apps, collars with a tracking device and motion/sound sensors. 
 In short, compared to other pet owners, Millennials are more likely to be anxious about the health and safety of their pets.  They also are more inclined to pamper, coddle and keep their pets with them whenever they can, while using technology to keep an eye on them when they are away from home.  If this sounds like pets play the role of surrogate children for many Millennials, it s because they do.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, the vast majority (71%) agree that having a pet is a good way to get ready for having a family.  Thus, for many 18- to 34-year-olds owning a pet is part of their transitioning into creating a family.  So, for many Millennials it may just be that looking out for Fido and taking care of Fifi is simply a way to get ready for bringing up baby.

Although aging Boomers will still account for the largest share of growth in the population of pet owners, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in the market for pet products and services.  According to Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data, more than four in 10 (44%) Millennials don t have a pet now but hope to have one in the future.  Packaged Facts projects that the Millennial generation will be responsible for adding 2.6 million pet owners between 2015 and 2020.

Packaged Facts  Millennials as Pet Market Consumers provides important insights for marketers trying to understand the mindset of 18- to 34-year-old pet owners.  For one thing, Millennial pet owners demonstrate an overwhelming urge to pamper their pets.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, they are much more likely than other pet owners to agree  I would rather spend money on pet toys and other products for my pets than on things for myself.   Millennials also are much more likely to  splurge  once in a while on an item for their pets and to enjoy purchasing products that pamper their pets.   So it is not surprising that Simmons National Consumer Study data show that both dog and cat owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are much more likely than other pet owners to buy toys and fashion accessories for their pets.

Millennials want pets they can pick up and carry wherever they go.  Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data show that 18- to 34-year-olds are much more likely to prefer to have a small pet  you can take with you more places.   Thus, dog owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are more likely than other dog owners to have small dogs weighing less than 25 pounds and much less likely to have dogs weighing over 40 pounds.

Millennials are more likely to coddle their pets when they feed them.  Around 30% of Millennial dog or cat owners prepare home-cooked meals for their pets, compared to just 19% of dog owners and 10% of cat owners in the 35- and-over age group.  Millennial dog or cat owners are more likely to prepare side dishes to add interest and nutrition to pre-made pet food.  Millennials also spend more money than other pet owners on treats and chews for their dogs or cats, suggesting that they especially like to reward their pets with treats and chews.

Millennials also appear to be a bit more obsessive about the health and safety of their pets.  For example, Millennial dog or cat owners express an elevated concern about the possibility of feeding their pets contaminated foods.  Besides being more involved in providing home-cooked foods for their pets, they are much more likely than other pet owners to use raw pet food or pet foods with formulations geared toward enhancing the health of their pets, such as organic, natural or non-GMO.

Moreover, compared to their older counterparts, 18- to 34-year-old pet owners are more fixated on keeping an eye on their pets.  They are much more likely to employ a wide range of technologies to track the activities of their pets and monitor the status of their health, including webcams, smartphone or tablet apps, collars with a tracking device and motion/sound sensors.

In short, compared to other pet owners, Millennials are more likely to be anxious about the health and safety of their pets.  They also are more inclined to pamper, coddle and keep their pets with them whenever they can, while using technology to keep an eye on them when they are away from home.  If this sounds like pets play the role of surrogate children for many Millennials, it s because they do.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, the vast majority (71%) agree that having a pet is a good way to get ready for having a family.  Thus, for many 18- to 34-year-olds owning a pet is part of their transitioning into creating a family.  So, for many Millennials it may just be that looking out for Fido and taking care of Fifi is simply a way to get ready for bringing up baby.","Packaging"
"The big reversal on GMO labeling","              June 10 -  Four years ago, a referendum, California Proposition_37, Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food, was added to the November 2012 ballot. Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural."" 
 As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum. 
 The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills. 
 Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.  
 The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016. 
 The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law. 
 At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling. 
 Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients. Not only will all of its vegetables, fruit cups and most tomato products be non-GMO, so, too, will the added ingredients used as sweeteners. The company indicated that more than 15 products will become non-GMO and be labeled as such. 
 Pointing the way for the other companies that would follow its lead, Campbell s insisted that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. However, the company issued a statement that read in part:  We have always believed that consumers have the right to know what s in their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue reaching a critical mass of 92% of consumers in favor of putting it on the label.  A sample label was prepared to indicate how Campbell would comply with the Vermont law and any future national legislation.  
 Campbell could also have pointed out that not only is there is not great support for GMO labeling, but in fact consumers are increasingly basing their food product purchasing decisions on whether or not there are GMO ingredients present. Packaged Facts research indicates that from 2013 to 2015 the percent of consumers who buy grocery products specifically labeled as non-GMO increased from over 29% to almost 39% while the percent who bought groceries labeled as organic in part to avoid GMO ingredients went from 27% to 35%. 
 Campbell indicated it would support a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging, noting that a national standard  would better inform consumers and would preempt numerous state labeling efforts, which are incomplete, impractical and confusing.  In deciding to back the labeling legislation Campbell announced it will withdraw from all efforts led by coalitions and groups opposing such measures. It called on all parties involved to come together and help create a workable national labeling plan. 
 One has to wonder if the Senate had voted to support legislation banning state GMO labeling laws if Campbell and the others that came out for GMO labeling would have done so. By its own admission, Campbell was aware that the vast majority of American consumers want labeling. It must also be aware that the percent of consumers actively seeking out non-GMO products is steadily increasing. 
 Perhaps the real issue is transparency. Americans seem to have lost their trust in large institutions: government, banks, and corporations. By fighting against GMO labeling, the food industry may have given more credibility to the notion that something is wrong with GMO ingredients than the anti-GMO forces were able to do. The companies that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting Prop 37 and the state-by-state efforts that followed might have done better for themselves with consumers by going along with GMO labeling four years ago when it would have seemed more credible for them to say,  GMOs are safe but we re happy to give you what you want.
