0,USDA: Half of consumers' food budgets spent on convenience," The findings suggest&nbsp;just how far manufacturers need to consider going when incorporating convenience into their product formulations, packaging and marketing messages. ",http://www.fooddive.com/news/usda-half-of-consumers-food-budgets-spent-on-convenience/423610/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:06:35 -0400",,"USDA: Half of consumers' food budgets spent on convenienceDetermining the best ways to improve convenience will be key to snagging a larger share of the average household food budget. Consumers dedicated about half of their household food budget to the most convenient foods purchased from fast-food and sit-down restaurants during the study's time frame.

Ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat meals and snacks comprised more than one-quarter (26%) of the average household food budget between 1999 and 2010, according to the report. And with the continued growth of snacking and demand for convenience since then, it's likely that percentage is even higher today.

RTE meals and snacks saw their portion of the average household food budget begin to increase across all geographic regions in 2007. RTC products' share of that budget remained fairly constant, USDA reported.

This shows how far manufacturers need to consider going to incorporate convenience into product formulations, packaging and marketing messages. RTC products are still desirable to consumers, but RTE products are where more growth opportunities lie. This includes segments like RTE snacks and liquid meal replacements, the latter of which are becoming increasingly preferred for morning meals when consumers are often on the go.

In terms of grocery store items, the convenience of the product and packaging itself seems to be more important than its advertising. USDA found that advertising investments significantly impacted fast food demand, but had little effect on RTE meals and snacks and other convenient foods.

1,How Hershey's new 'snackfection' could impact the industry," It's all about &quot;sticky innovation&quot; that &quot;allows you then to expand even across brands because you&rsquo;ve identified a need state that is really important,&quot; CEO John Bilbrey said on a recent earnings call. ",http://www.fooddive.com/news/how-hersheys-new-snackfection-could-impact-the-industry/423606/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:22:43 -0400",,"How Hershey's new 'snackfection' could impact the industryThe commitment to ""snackfection"" and consumers' demands for more complex textures has already been apparent in Hershey's acquisitive growth in addition to internal innovation investments.

Earlier this year, Hershey announced its acquisition of barkTHINS, a premium snacking chocolate brand that combines chocolate with ingredients like almonds, coconut and pretzels. In time for last year's holiday season, Hershey also launched Hershey's Kisses Deluxe, which added complexity to conventional Hershey's Kisses by incorporating a hazelnut center and rice crisps in the chocolate.

It's notable that Hershey has teased its upcoming ""significant innovation"" in the realm of snackfection well before its anticipated fourth-quarter launch.

The early announcement of new products can have mixed results. Campbell and Keurig announced a partnership to create Campbell's soup K-Cups about two years before the product actually debuted, when growth for single-serve beverages was surging. But Campbell ended up discontinuing the product less than a year later, in part because consumer sentiment toward the perceived wastefulness of single-serve packaging had begun to take hold by the time the product finally launched.

On the other hand, pre-merger Kraft Foods announced in April 2015 that it would remove artificial colors and flavors from its iconic Kraft Macaroni and Cheese brand. It did not re-announce the product's actual debut in stores, choosing instead to quietly release the reformulated product in December. It wasn't until March that Kraft Heinz announced it had released the new version of the product to stores, undetected by consumers or the media.

The key for Hershey's success with this new innovation will rely on just how relevant and broadly impacting a trend like snackfection might be. Considering separately the fast growth of snack foods and the continued growth of indulgent products like chocolate, the combination of the two segments could have the desired flavor and texture impact and figurative stickiness Hershey is after.

2,"Crafty, natural and convenient: How spirits are keeping on trend"," These spirited innovations have included better-for-you ingredients, exotic flavors and aromas, easy preparation, authenticity&nbsp;and&nbsp;portable packaging. ",http://www.fooddive.com/news/crafty-natural-and-convenient-how-spirits-are-keeping-on-trend/423603/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 06:39:18 -0400",,"Crafty, natural and convenient: How spirits are keeping on trendReports released this year by the Distilled Spirits Council and Technavio both confirm that the spirits segment is growing at a faster clip than beer and wine. Part of the reason is health-related, because consumers may feel more control over sugar and calorie content by being able to select their mixers. How healthy and natural ingredients are, as well as how products are developed and manufactured, also factor in consumers' spirits purchase decisions, according to Technavio.

Bill Owens, president of American Distilling Institute, told Food Dive last year that the craft spirits industry was growing at about 30% per year. But craft distillers face a number of challenges when attempting to open a distillery, ranging from obtaining zoning permits to acquiring rare distilling equipment, he said.

Still, Owens believes craft spirits will eventually enjoy a similar growth pattern to what craft beer has seen over the past decade. As of 2015, craft beer now comprises about 12% of the overall beer industry in the U.S., according to the Brewers Associaton. The craft spirits industry currently makes up about 1% of the total spirits market, according to Owens.

But these trends are also critical for major players like Diageo and Constellation Brands, which produce both beer and spirit brands, and have to focus innovation investments in the right segments and brands to maintain consumer appeal and relevance. For Constellation, that has included investments in the Mexican beer and craft beer portfolios. For Diageo, that recently led to the first investment by the company's accelerator in a non-alcoholic spirits producer.",FNB,FNB,"acquiring rare distilling equipment,owens believes craft spirits,american distilling institute,similar growth pattern,maintain consumer appeal,told food dive,obtaining zoning permits,craft distillers face,distilled spirits council,spirits purchase decisions,non-alcoholic spirits producer,total spirits market,focus innovation investments,craft spirits industry,craft beer portfolios,craft beer,spirits segment,beer industry,included investments,bill owens,trendreports released,eventually enjoy,easy preparation,recently led,exotic flavors,included better-for-,calorie content,major players,spirited innovations,faster clip,brewers associaton,portable packaging,past decade,mexican beer,spirit brands,authenticity&nbsp,constellation brands,natural ingredients","For Constellation, that has included investments in the Mexican beer and craft beer portfolios.

With the Duncan Hines Perfect Size line, Pinnacle addressed the changing market dynamic of smaller households and consumers' desire to avoid leftovers. By creating smaller portion sizes appropriate for smaller families, Pinnacle contributes to the reduction of food waste on the consumer level. The company also responds to consumers' demand for convenience by providing not only the cake mix, but also icing and cake pan needed to prepare it.

These innovations are crucial for the baking mixes category, which has seen sales tumble in recent years. Simpler ingredients have been one solution that companies, particularly startups, have pursued, but making baking products more convenient and less wasteful was enough to catch GMA's attention.

4,SmartLabel's role in GMO labeling compliance   and industry transparency, A handful of companies have demonstrated &mdash; before President Obama signed&nbsp;the GMO labeling law&nbsp;on Friday &mdash; how the initiative could shape the future. ,http://www.fooddive.com/news/smartlabels-role-in-gmo-labeling-compliance-and-industry-transparency/423595/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 05:10:30 -0400",,"SmartLabel's role in GMO labeling compliance   and industry transparencyGMO labeling is officially mandatory, and QR codes could become the new standard on the grocery aisle.

On Friday, the White House announced that President Obama had signed the mandatory GMO labeling bill into law. Congress had passed the bill two weeks before, and the White House had already said it expected the president to sign the bill earlier in the month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture now has two years to iron out the details of the law, including details surrounding the use of QR codes printed on product packaging as one option for disclosing GMO ingredients. A group of vocal consumers and public health advocates have pushed back against the use of QR codes, saying that electronic disclosure discriminates against demographics without smartphones to scan the codes while in stores.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association s SmartLabel initiative, launched last December, represents one option for QR codes. Several manufacturers have already started using SmartLabel to disclose GMO ingredients and about 360 other product and company attributes. These companies demonstrated   before the law took effect   the role SmartLabel may play in the future of transparency in the food industry.

Because of recent legislation in Congress, SmartLabel has been linked to GMO labeling in the public eye. Did GMA develop SmartLabel specifically for GMO labeling?

""A definitive no,"" said Jim Flannery, GMA s senior executive vice president of operations and industry affairs, and a leader of the SmartLabel project.

""SmartLabel actually started as a board conversation we had about two years ago,"" said Flannery. ""It was very much a food and a non-food conversation around, as industry, we've got a responsibility to address the consumer s growing thirst for knowledge. We have to find a way to get consumers the information they re seeking about the food, beverage and consumer products that they use. It was not any one issue that drove it.""

Taking a step back further, Hershey had conducted early consumer research in 2014 to generate an initial prototype for SmartLabel, Deb Arcoleo, director of product transparency, told Food Dive. Hershey saw SmartLabel as a potential mobile tool for industry transparency, and at that time, GMO labeling ""really wasn t even on our radar,"" Arcoleo said.

""The driver really was a lot of   especially if you look in food   there are a lot of badges and icons and certifications, and packaging starts to look like a Nascar car,"" said Arcoleo. ""Our CEO in particular said, there's so much people want to know about food... The package is just a poor fit for delivering information. That's not what it was intended for.""

""Meanwhile you've got smartphone ownership statistics going up dramatically year over year over year,"" Arcoleo continued. ""Isn't there something better that we can do and couldn't we play a leadership role and get industry to align with us and do something really groundbreaking? That was really the impetus for it.""

As of mid-July, the SmartLabel database contained information on more than 1,200 items from nearly a dozen companies, ranging from major players like Hershey and Campbell, to smaller companies like Naked Bacon and Food for Life.

GMO disclosure was voluntary though that will soon change but all producers on the database had voluntarily provided GMO ingredient disclosure, Flannery said. That s along with a host of other product details. These range from allergens which Flannery says is the most-clicked area on the site to ingredient origin and company details.

GMA conducted member surveys to help predict future adoption of SmartLabel across the industry. When the initiative began, 36 companies signed on to label an estimated 34,000 items in the market by the end of December 2017, Flannery said. Another 48 companies agreed to participate in the program but needed more time to devise an implementation forecast. With those companies, Flannery said a ""conservative"" estimate for participating items will cross the 60,000 threshold into 2018.

But now that SmartLabel may be an acceptable option for mandatory GMO labeling regulations, the adoption rate could increase. Increased demand for transparency could also drive SmartLabel adoption.

As more companies adopt SmartLabel particularly larger manufacturers with many products and SmartLabel s visibility increases, companies that haven t adopted it could ""be at a bit of a disadvantage potentially from a consumer perspective,"" Arcoleo said.

""A consumer might assume, inaccurately maybe, that they re trying to hide something or that they don t want to share all this information, and that might not be the case at all,"" Arcoleo said.

SmartLabel holds promise for smaller natural and organic companies as much as major players, Flannery said.

""There are some interesting companies that have jumped in,"" said Flannery. ""I guess not so surprising, but this is really attractive for the smaller organic businesses. You'll see Food for Life and Naked Bacon in there   those are brands that have a consumer base who really values transparency. They're some of the first brands to participate in SmartLabel.""

One hindrance to SmartLabel is that the program is not free and requires an investment to participate. But Arcoleo noted that printing SmartLabel or an on-packaged statement is still a packaging change with similar costs.

""I think honestly it s going to depend on whether the company sees value in being a full SmartLabel brand program participant, which means agreeing to display that landing page in all of its glory   not just the GMO piece,  said Arcoleo. ""If they see value in that, then I think they will say, 'This is great. We can comply with the federal law, and we can also provide our consumers with a lot of information about our products.'""

In late 2015, Hershey became the first brand to adopt SmartLabel for its Hershey s Holiday Kisses. Without any marketing to support its SmartLabel adoption, as of mid-July, Hershey had seen about 47,000 QR code scans from about 26,000 unique users on the 300 products currently labeled with the QR code in stores, Arcoleo said. Hershey plans to have the entirety of its portfolio labeled with the QR code by the end of 2017.

Campbell sent a shockwave through the industry in January when it became the first major manufacturer to commit to label GMO ingredients across its portfolio, followed by several other manufacturers a few months later. But even though Campbell could use SmartLabel to abide by mandatory GMO labeling regulations, a company spokesperson told Food Dive that Campbell plans to maintain its commitment to printing ""clear and simple language about the presence of GMO ingredients on the labels of all of our U.S. products.""

However, Campbell will still participate in SmartLabel, just not via QR codes. Product information for three items condensed tomato, cream of mushroom and chicken noodle soups is listed on both the product database on SmartLabel.org and the company s own www.whatsinmyfood.com, ""with plans to add more over time,"" the spokesperson said. This represents another option for manufacturers that are grappling with whether to use a QR code or on-package disclosure.

Flannery also applauded Unilever s Hellmann s mayonnaise brand, which goes beyond typical product and ingredient disclosure. It includes details like sourcing of the soy for the product s soy oil ingredient from Iowa and Ontario, Canada.

SmartLabel s role in not just GMO labeling, but transparency across the food and beverage industry, has only just begun. Flannery said that GMA plans to launch broad scale communications to inform consumers about SmartLabel in the latter part of 2017. By then, GMA expects SmartLabel adoption to hit a  critical mass  and will be widespread enough that consumers can easily find the QR codes in stores, Flannery said.",FNB,FNB,"voluntarily provided gmo ingredient disclosure,full smartlabel brand program participant,launch broad scale communications,company spokesperson told food dive,gma conducted member surveys,senior executive vice president,conducted early consumer research,mandatory gmo labeling regulations,gma develop smartlabel specifically,president obama signed&nbsp,mandatory gmo labeling bill,gmo labeling law&nbsp,gma expects smartlabel adoption,smartlabel database contained information,told food dive,smartphone ownership statistics,potential mobile tool,chicken noodle soups,gmo labeling compliance,electronic disclosure discriminates,disclose gmo ingredients,disclosing gmo ingredients,public health advocates,white house announced,soy oil ingredient,including details surrounding,smaller organic businesses,smartlabel holds promise,items condensed tomato,industry transparencygmo labeling,label gmo ingredients,drive smartlabel adoption,predict future adoption,000 qr code scans,qr codes printed,grocery manufacturers association,companies adopt smartlabel,gmo labeling,ingredient disclosure,president obama,gmo disclosure,gmo ingredients,officially mandatory,ingredient origin,white house,gmo piece,on-package disclosure,adoption rate,gma plans,mayonnaise brand,smartlabel adoption,public eye,grocery aisle,qr code,company details,company sees,company attributes,smaller natural,bill earlier,adopt smartlabel,organic companies,qr codes,36 companies signed,smaller companies,product database,similar costs,packaging starts,non-food conversation,growing thirst,step back,000 unique users,board conversation,holiday kisses,critical mass,visibility increases,major players,landing page,most-clicked area,consumer perspective,major manufacturer,consumer base,increased demand,poor fit,recent legislation,implementation forecast,nascar car,disadvantage potentially,on-packaged statement,applauded unilever,pushed back,simple language,naked bacon,initial prototype,includes details,means agreeing,demonstrated &mdash,delivering information,smartlabel project,dozen companies,companies demonstrated,48 companies agreed,interesting companies,federal law,typical product,product details,product packaging,participating items,industry affairs,initiative began,larger manufacturers,product information,values transparency,years ago,smartlabel initiative,friday &mdash,packaging change,easily find,inform consumers,food industry,vocal consumers,leadership role,dramatically year,printing smartlabel,arcoleo noted,deb arcoleo,arcoleo continued,product transparency,industry transparency,acceptable option,role smartlabel,beverage industry,consumer products,jim flannery,gma,spokesperson,portfolio labeled,campbell plans,hershey plans,president,brand,company,signed,bill","SmartLabel's role in GMO labeling compliance   and industry transparencyGMO labeling is officially mandatory, and QR codes could become the new standard on the grocery aisle.

But it has also brought opposition from a vocal group of consumers and public health advocates. They believe a QR code is an insufficient labeling method and discriminates against certain demographics who do not have regular access to a smartphone that can scan the QR codes in the store.

As of Thursday morning, more than 100,000 people had signed a White House petition requesting that the president veto the bill. However, Politico called the petition ""too little too late,"" as the White House already said earlier in the month that President Obama would sign the bill. FoodDemocracyNow! said in a statement sent to Food Dive that lawyers representing the organization were mounting a legal challenge for issues including ""its infringement on the 14th amendment of the Constitution that guarantees 'equal protection for all.'""

Earlier this year, before even Vermont's mandatory GMO labeling bill took effect, several companies pledged to label GMO ingredients on product packaging. However, now that a QR code is a legally viable option, it's unclear whether these companies will end up switching from on-package to electronic disclosure.

A spokesperson for Campbell, the first of the wave to make the commitment and a vocal supporter of mandatory GMO labeling, told Food Dive that it would continue printing its GMO ingredients disclosure on its packaging while also listing its products in the Smart Label database.

But several other companies have already been labeling GMO ingredients using the now approved method of a QR code, specifically with the Grocery Manufacturers Association's SmartLabel. That includes Hershey, which helped pioneer it. The company had already seen 47,000 QR code scans on the 300 products that currently bear SmartLabel though it had not yet done any promotion of what SmartLabel is or does, Hershey's director of product transparency Deb Arcoleo told Food Dive.

""In reaching its decision, the board has considered the best interests of the company as a whole and has taken into account all salient facts and circumstances. The board has also received extensive shareholder feedback and considered the views of our financial advisers,"" SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis said in a statement.

Shareholders remain mixed on how the deal measures up, since the British sterling has dropped significantly following the Brexit vote in June. Some shareholders have said that the deal undervalues the company, whicl others are embracing it.

Advancement of this deal comes at a good time for AB InBev, which is the world's largest brewer. The company reported Friday that overall revenue dropped 2.2% to $10.81 billion in the second quarter. Total beer volumes dipped 1.7%. Not including currency fluctuations, organic revenue inched up 4% on higher pricing strategies. In Brussels trading Friday, shares rose 4.6%.

SABMiller also offers AB InBev critical market access in the Latin American and African regions, which are opportunities for growth as AB InBev has seen sales taper off in the U.S. market.

AB InBev's quarterly net profit seemed to have plunged to $152 million from $1.93 billion a year earlier. But the declining value of the British sterling is at play here, along with one-time finance costs related to the SABMiller deal. However, SABMiller shares trading in London were up 2.1%.

Earlier this week, Anheuser-Busch InBev increased its bid for SABMiller to  45 per share from the original  44 per share bid. But even with the increased bid per share, the total deal value currently sits at about $104 billion, still below the approximately $108 billion value the deal carried back in November. AB InBev also raised the cash portion of its partial-share offer by 88 pence   about $1.15   per share, but that deal had increased in value on its own because AB InBev s shares are based in the euro.

Traditionally, manufacturers hand those tasks over to agencies.

But manufacturers are realizing the benefit in being more closely involved with online and offline marketing initiatives. In some cases, they are also realizing the profits.

In May, PepsiCo unveiled a content creation studio that other parties can use to generate revenue that can supplement PepsiCo s own marketing spend for its brands. Later that month, Mondelez also announced it would be expanding its in-house marketing efforts to shift away from the more traditional advertising that consumers respond less to today.

Directly engaging with consumers has become increasingly important to brands, even as far as enabling consumers to vote on which products are added or removed from a brand s portfolio.

This has also awakened sales and profits for B&G Foods as a whole, which otherwise would have seen sales declines without its acquisitive growth.

Part of Green Giant s portfolio is based in frozen vegetables, a subcategory in a larger frozen foods segment that has seen sales tumble in recent years.

But with a renewed focus on pushing the brand forward, Green Giant has a chance to win back the market share it lost to brands like Pinnacle s Birds Eye. By doing so, Green Giant could also make B&G Foods a larger competitor in the processed foods industry.

If B&G continues to  awaken the Green Giant,  the company may more proactively pursue its growth, and revitalize its own business in the process. Cantwell already said late last year that the company would be open to more acquisitions, and other companies, such as ConAgra, may be looking to shed underperforming brands in the near future.

James Bennett, brand detective, C&P Melbourne said:  Chiko Rolls were the original one-handed snack. But people needed a reminder of the best occasion to enjoy them.

This one-handed snack would become the perfect meal before the meal. 

However, further cultural trend analysis showed that in this modern media landscape, consumers are overwhelmed with messages on a daily basis and the re-launch of Chiko needed a radical approach to cut through.

21,Bioengineered wheat found in Washington state,USDA says no evidence suggests the banned wheat has entered US commercial supplies,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Business_News/2016/08/Bioengineered_wheat_found_in_W.aspx?ID=%7B6AAD1CD3-1D0B-4F95-A55E-8A3520EDB7EA%7D,"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 13:53:00 CST",Business News,"Bioengineered wheat found in Washington stateWASHINGTON   The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) on July 29 confirmed the discovery of 22 genetically engineered (G.E.) wheat plants growing in an unplanted agricultural field in Washington state. The bioengineered wheat found on the Washington farm was developed by Monsanto to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, also known as Roundup.

APHIS said it has taken  prompt and thorough action  in response to the discovery and has found  no evidence  of bioengineered wheat in commerce.

The bioengineered wheat is being referred to as MON 71700, containing the CP4-EPSPS protein. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) previously evaluated crops containing the CP4-EPSPS protein for safety through its voluntary biotechnology consultation process.

 Due to the small number of affected plants, and based on the available information about MON 71700 and CP4-EPSPS, F.D.A. concluded it is unlikely that the wheat would present any safety concerns if present in the food supply as a result of this incident,  APHIS said.

APHIS said it has worked with the farmer to ensure that no bioengineered wheat moves into commerce.

 Out of an abundance of caution, APHIS is testing the farmer s full wheat harvest for the presence of any G.E. material,  APHIS said.  The farmer s harvest is complete, and it continues to be held while U.S.D.A. completes tests of the grain. So far all samples continue to be negative for any G.E. material. If any wheat tests positive for G.E. material, the farmer s crop will not be allowed in commerce. 

St. Louis-based Monsanto has developed a test that will identify MON 71700 in commercial grain shipments, and the U.S.D.A. has validated the test and its sensitivity level so that trading partners may use the test for wheat imports, if they choose.

There are no bioengineered wheat varieties for sale or in commercial production in the United States at this time, as APHIS has not deregulated any bioengineered wheat varieties.

The U.S.D.A. in recent years has taken steps to strengthen its oversight of regulated G.E. field trials, and APHIS now requires developers to apply for a permit for field trials involving bioengineered wheat beginning with G.E. wheat planted on or after Jan. 1, 2016.

 The decision to require the more stringent permit process rather than the notification process employed in the past, provides added protection that G.E. wheat will remain confined during field trials,  APHIS said.

The finding marks the third such incident involving bioengineered wheat since mid-2013, when bioengineered wheat was discovered on a farm in Oregon. Following that finding, some countries in Asia temporarily suspended U.S. wheat imports. Then, in 2014, bioengineered wheat was found near a Montana State University crop research facility. Both varieties were found to have been developed by Monsanto.

US Wheat Associates, the National Association of Wheat Growers and the Washington Grain Commission issued a joint statement on July 29 saying they are aware of the latest finding.

 The agency (APHIS) has kept our organizations, as well as government officials in several key overseas markets, informed as it worked to find the facts,  the groups said.  In turn, our organizations have shared information about the situation with the domestic grain trade and downstream customer organizations, as well as overseas grain trade and buyers in several countries that import U.S. wheat. U.S.W. believes that some of those customers will be temporarily cautious about new imports of some U.S. wheat until they can put the validated grain test to work locally. U.S.D.A. says that could happen as soon as next week. Since there is no evidence of G.E. wheat in commercial supplies, we expect the testing to confirm that, so if any market disruption occurs, we think it will be short-lived. 

In addition to the groups giving a vote of confidence in the way APHIS has managed the situation, the Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Farms and Rural Affairs issued a public statement saying there is no concern from Korean officials that bioengineered wheat will be introduced into Korea.

Grain import officials in Japan and Korea have tested for the bioengineered wheat identified in 2013 in virtually every load of U.S. wheat delivered to those countries since August 2013 and have had no incidences. In addition, researchers at Washington State University have been conducting routine phenotype screening for glyphosate tolerance in wheat since 2013.

 In each of the last three growing seasons, this field screening process has involved more than 80 varieties, 2,000 advanced breeding lines and more than 35,000 individual plots,  U.S. Wheat and NAWG said.  Varieties included in these trials represent more than 95% of the wheat acreage planted in the state of Washington and much of the acreage planted in Oregon and Idaho. Screening to date has revealed no glyphosate tolerant wheat plants in these trials.

 The federal systems in place ensure that unauthorized biotech products are tightly regulated and do not enter commercial channels. In fact, APHIS recently changed its rules to require developers to apply for a permit for field trials involving G.E. wheat. APHIS said this more stringent process will add protection that G.E. wheat will remain confined during the trials.

 Nothing is more important to the U.S. wheat industry than the trust we have earned with customers at home and around the world by providing a reliable supply of high-quality wheat. We thank our customers for their reasonable approach to this situation and we are confident that public and private breeders and federal regulators are taking all appropriate actions to ensure that U.S. wheat, wheat flour and wheat foods remain safe, wholesome and nutritious for people, and in animal feed, around the world.

22,President signs G.M.O. labeling bill into law,The new law will allow the food industry to use labels symbols or a link to a web site to disclose the presence of bioengineered ingredients,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Regulatory_News/2016/08/President_signs_GMO_labeling_b.aspx?ID=%7B385335BC-3E77-42F7-91C4-C0126215AECE%7D,"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 13:44:00 CST",Regulatory News,"President signs G.M.O. labeling bill into lawWASHINGTON   President Barack Obama on July 29 signed S. 754, which directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard.

The law nullifies the Vermont mandatory G.M.O. labeling law that took effect July 1. The law requires food manufacturers to disclose the presence of bioengineered ingredients in one of three ways: text on the package, a symbol on the package or a link to a web site (a quick response code or similar technology).

Many in the food industry support the law.

 This legislation will open a new era for transparency in ingredient information for consumers, by requiring disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients for families in every state across the nation,  said Pamela G. Bailey, president and chief executive officer of the Washington-based Grocery Manufacturers Association.  Its consistent national standard is far better than a costly and confusing patchwork of different state labeling. The president s signing of this legislation also stops, effective immediately, Vermont s mandatory on-package labeling law that went into effect July 1 and already has left consumers in the state with fewer products on the shelves and higher compliance costs for small businesses. 

Gary Hirshberg, chairman of Just Label It and co-founder of Stonyfield Farm, Londonderry, N.H., urged food companies to go with the option of putting  clear and simple  labels on their products.

 Consumers have already begun to see G.M.O. labeling disclosures on many familiar food packages as companies prepared to comply with Vermont s groundbreaking law,  he said.  In the wake of the creation of a national, mandatory labeling system, Campbell s, Mars and Dannon have already publicly committed to keeping this simple disclosure on their packages as U.S.D.A. sorts out the rules for implementation of this new law. I have sent a letter to other industry leaders asking them to publicly commit to keeping consumers out of the dark when it comes to G.M.O.s in our food.

Rickland OrchardsPARSIPPANY, N.J.   B&G Foods, Inc. has discontinued Rickland Orchards, the business it acquired in October 2013 for $57.4 million. Originally launched in 2012, Rickland Orchards was a manufacturer of Greek yogurt-coated granola bars and bites.

    We discontinued the Rickland Orchards brand as a result of continued insufficient demand,  said Tom Crimmins, chief financial officer for B&G Foods, during a conference call on July 29 to discuss the company s second-quarter financial results.  Accordingly, we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to amortizable trademarks and customer relationship intangibles of $4.5 million and $0.9 million. We also recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of approximately $0.8 million in connection with the write-off of raw material and finished goods inventory for the brand. 

Robert Cantwell, president and chief executive officer, added that the discontinuation of the Rickland business will allow B&G Foods to divert more resources to the execution of the company s strategy around its New York Style snack brand, which has been challenged recently.

Under B&G Foods, Rickland Orchards was never able to gain traction in the marketplace. Under B&G Foods  ownership, Rickland Orchards went from approximately $50 million in sales at the time it was acquired to a little over $15 million in the first half of 2014. Challenges facing the brand were numerous, including the fact it was not a well-known retail brand with a lot of shelf space. Rickland Orchards initially established its business in the warehouse/club channel. Additionally, competitors were able to copy the businesses  line of products and undercut its price in warehouse and club stores.

In October 2014, a year after acquiring the brand, B&G Foods took an impairment charge of $22.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. The charge was primarily associated with the continued decline of the Rickland business. By the third quarter, Rickland Orchards was only generating $4.5 million in sales, and B&G Foods  management said it did not expect sales for the brand to grow beyond that for the foreseeable future.",FNB,FNB,"greek yogurt-coated granola bars,greek yogurt covered productsr,rickland orchardsbg foods recently discontinued,york style snack brand,recorded non-cash impairment charges,rickland orchards initially established,related intangible assets,customer relationship intangibles,chief executive officer,second-quarter financial results,chief financial officer,finished goods inventory,continued insufficient demand,discontinued rickland orchards,rickland orchards brand,challenged recently,rickland orchards,rickland orchardsparsippany,goods sold,continued decline,impairment charge,rickland business,club stores,warehouse/club channel,shelf space,foreseeable future,conference call,tom crimmins,raw material,originally launched,challenges facing,amortizable trademarks,gain traction,robert cantwell,retail brand,foods  ownership,foods  management,businesses  line,expect sales,discontinued","Robert Cantwell, president and chief executive officer, added that the discontinuation of the Rickland business will allow B&G Foods to divert more resources to the execution of the company s strategy around its New York Style snack brand, which has been challenged recently.

Pinnacle Foods got a bigger boost than expected from Boulder Brands in the second quarter ended June 26. Net sales in the quarter increased nearly 20% for Pinnacle, largely reflecting the benefits of the Boulder Brands acquisition, which contributed $122,607,000 in sales, and growth of 1.6% from North America retail.

Pinnacle Foods completed its acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan. 15. EBIT for Boulder Brands in the second quarter was $7,028,000. Retail consumption versus year-ago advanced for the Glutino, Udi s, Earth Balance and Evol brands, offset by a moderate decline for Smart Balance.

Adjusted EBIT for Boulder was $17.2 million, said Mark Clouse, chief executive officer for Pinnacle, in a July 28 earnings call.

 The adjusted EBIT performance reflected input cost inflation and better-than-planned supply chain productivity,  he said.

Mr. Clouse said Boulder Brands has a  meaningful  business with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Bentonville, Ark.

 We did have distribution in Wal-Mart on several of the brands,  he said.

Pinnacle now expects Boulder Brands to contribute about 7c to 8c of adjusted, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year, which compares to a previous expectation of 5c. Craig Steeneck, chief financial officer for Pinnacle, said the company now expects Boulder Brands to approach EBITDA growth of 65% from 2015 to 2017, which compares to an original target of 50%.

Parsippany-based Pinnacle Foods reported overall net sales of $756,381,000 in the quarter, up from $631,746,000 in the previous year s second quarter. Net earnings of $45,783,000, or 39c per share on the common stock, marked a 5% increase from $43,679,000, or 38c per share, in the previous year s second quarter.

Adjusted net earnings were $49,979,000, or 42c per share, which compared with $41,936,000, or 36c per share, in the previous year s second quarter. Adjusted net earnings exclude Boulder, Wish-Bone and Gardein anticipated synergies that are included in calculating covenant compliance.

Pinnacle Foods raised its adjusted, diluted earnings per share for fiscal-year 2016 to a range of $2.10 to $2.15 from a range of $2.08 to $2.13.

North America retail for Pinnacle consists of the Birds Eye Frozen segment and the Duncan Hines Grocery segment.

Second-quarter EBIT for Birds Eye Frozen increased 23% to $46,794,000 in the second quarter, which compared with $37,978,000 in the previous year s second quarter. Net sales growth and productivity savings drove EBIT growth, which was offset partially by modest input cost inflation, a double-digit increase in marketing investment and items affecting comparability, particularly unrealized mark-to-market impacts.

Net sales within Birds Eye Frozen rose 6% in the second quarter to $285,155,000 from $268,859,000. Recently introduced items behind the Birds Eye Voila!, Birds Eye Flavor Full, Birds Eye Protein Blends and Birds Eye Disney-themed platforms fueled the Birds Eye franchise.

 Heading into the important holiday seasons later this year, we feel really good about the momentum we have behind our Birds Eye franchise, and we re confident in our plans to continue to drive growth for the balance of this year and next,  Mr. Clouse said.  Our strategy and strong execution on this business has allowed Birds Eye over the last few years to transform not only frozen vegetables and meals but also to some degree the entire frozen aisle. 

The Gardein brand saw a double-digit increase in retail velocity.

EBIT in the second quarter for the Duncan Hines Grocery segment increased 2.4% to $52,255,000 from $51,041,000. Strong productivity and items affecting comparability drove the growth. Net sales for the Duncan Hines Grocery segment dropped 2.7% to $270,471,000 from $277,994,000.

Within the Specialty Foods segment, EBIT of $6,333,000 in the second quarter marked a decrease of 17% from $7,599,000 in the previous year s second quarter. Net sales dropped 8% to $78,148,000 from $84,893,000, reflecting lower volume/mix of 8.2%, partially offset by higher net price realization of 0.3%. Lower sales of private label canned meat drove the expected decline in volume/mix.

For the six months ended June 26, Pinnacle Foods posted net earnings of $70,620,000, or 61c per share, which marked a 17% decrease from $85,215,000, or 73c per share, in the same time period of the previous year.

Slated to launch from the Campbell Soup Co. later this year is a range of non-dairy, plant-based milk with 10 grams of pea protein per serving. Bolthouse Farms Plant Protein Milk varieties include vanilla, unsweetened, original and chocolate. The product line represents the Camden-based company s foray into the burgeoning alternative milk category, which is expected to double in size by 2020 to reach $4 billion in sales, said Jeff Dunn, president of the Campbell Fresh division.

 Unlike other alternative milks it is made with 100% pea protein and has 10 grams of protein per serving, 2 more than traditional milk and 9 grams more than almond milk,  Mr. Dunn said during a presentation at the company s Institutional Investor Day on July 20.  With this highly differentiated product we have already received promising interest from dairy buyers across the country and are poised to make a strong option for consumers who are moving toward plant-based diets and away from animal proteins. 

The Campbell Fresh division includes refrigerated product categories merchandised in the produce and deli sections of grocery stores, with such products as fresh carrots, beverages, salad dressing, salsa, hummus, dips, deli chips and fresh soups under the brands Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet, which Campbell Soup acquired last year.

As part of efforts to expand Campbell Fresh into new spaces, the company is adopting an entrepreneurial approach to innovation, Mr. Dunn said.

 If you step up to a 30,000 foot view, what we built is an ecosystem designed to marry our internal capabilities with those of external partners who are best in class at taking great ideas and turning them into great businesses,  he said.  Through our dynamic learning loops we assess opportunities and put them on the best innovation pathway to help ideas flourish and grow at a rapid pace. With this approach we believe we can be more nimble and, importantly, place more bets on the table to significantly increase the success rate of these new platform ideas. Our long-term innovation approach is designed with a startup mentality driving more ideas into the marketplace with the ability to move quickly and pivot quickly. 

Within this approach, Campbell Fresh is focusing on three types of platform innovation: bringing current center-store categories to the perimeter, reinventing traditional perimeter categories that need renovation, and finding new business models and channel formats to meet consumer needs directly where they shop and eat, Mr. Dunn said.

 This team has been built for robust idea generation, quick vetting and importantly rapid pivots to live in market incubations as quickly as possible,  he said.

Capturing new sources of  breakthrough innovation  is one of several priorities for the Campbell Fresh division in the coming year. The company also is focused on stabilizing and maintaining its core carrot business, which was negatively impacted by poor growing conditions last year, and leveraging its consumer packaged goods portfolio for sustained growth.

 Research has shown that twice as many millennials versus non-millennials only shop the perimeter of the grocery store,  Mr. Dunn said.  This new behavior gives us great confidence the development of the C-Fresh division and our investment in more packaged fresh categories will continue to pay dividends into the future as more consumers adopt this lifestyle. 

Campbell Fresh is expanding its portfolio of premium beverages with the introduction of new Bolthouse Farms smoothies and protein-plus varieties and 1915 plant-based protein drinks and organic smoothies. On the deli side, new flavors and formats of hummus and salsa will debut from the Garden Fresh Gourmet business.

 Similar to Bolthouse Farms in produce, our vision is to build the Garden Fresh Gourmet brand portfolio so it can meet consumer needs for various occasions across snacking and simple meals,  Mr. Dunn said.  We will continue to build out the Garden Fresh brand across multiple categories in deli but we will also introduce new brands   similar to what we did with 1915 in beverages. 

Coming this fall are two branded refrigerated soup offerings, including a conventional lineup under the Garden Fresh Gourmet brand and an  ultra-premium  organic range called Souplicity, which the company plans to test in the natural and organic channel.

 Customer reception to Garden Fresh Gourmet soups has been very positive, and we ve already received commitments from several large key customers beyond our current private label customers,  Mr. Dunn said.  This new branded platform has the potential to not only take our fresh soup business to new heights but also to expand awareness and trial of the Garden Fresh brand as we drive more scale across more deli categories. 

Challenges affecting the company s carrot business, including weather, a customer moving to a second supplier, and a soft Japanese economy, hurt the division s results in the recent quarter. Segment operating earnings fell 28% to $13 million, and, excluding the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, sales declined 4% in the third quarter ended May 1. A recall in June of Bolthouse Farms protein beverages due to spoilage initiated is expected to further hamper performance for the full year.

 So, needless to say we have had some unanticipated challenges in the back half, but we are confident about the future because our mission hasn t changed and the opportunities that that mission provides are significant as we look forward,  Mr. Dunn said.  The C-Fresh division fully supports and contributes to the company s purpose of real food that matters for life s moments by inspiring the fresh revolution. This mission is the cornerstone of everything we do and our strategy comes to life by making fresher foods more accessible, available, affordable and most importantly desirable across a range of fast-growing categories. Because ultimately, as you know, there is a shift happening; fresh is accelerating.

27,Ingredion earnings rise on strength in North America,Net sales up narrowly on more favorable product mix in both specialty and core ingredients,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2016/07/Ingredion_earnings_rise_on_str.aspx?ID=%7BEA754622-E55B-43BD-BEDB-D820843C449F%7D,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 13:26:00 CST",FinancialPerformance,"Ingredion earnings rise on strength in North AmericaWESTCHESTER, ILL.   Ingredion, Inc. delivered another strong quarter of growth as net income in the second quarter ended June 30 increased 10% to $117.2 million, equal to $1.62 per share on the common stock, up from $106.7 million, or $1.49 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

For the first six months of the year Ingredion posted earnings of $247.7 million, or $3.44 per share, up 30% from $190.3 million, or $2.66 per share, in the same period a year ago.

 I am pleased with our results this quarter,  Ilene Gordon, president and chief executive officer, said during a July 28 conference call with analysts.  From a strategic perspective our business model and blueprint for growth are working and our momentum continues on a positive trajectory.

 I am also pleased that our global footprint and our innovation capabilities with our 25 Ingredion Idea Labs allow us to meet the needs of our customers who demand on-trend products customized to local tastes. We continue to take actions to optimize our cost structure for the future while investing for growth in our specialty business.

 Regionally, North America is expected to continue its positive trajectory. Asia-Pacific and EMEA are projecting operating income growth and South America is expected to be down versus last year given the macroeconomic headwinds. With our strong balance sheet we expect to continue deploying our capital to fuel organic growth, network optimization, acquisitions and other shareholder friendly action. 

Overall net sales at Ingredion were up narrowly in the second quarter to $1,455.3 million as a result of improved price/mix in North America and South America and a more favorable product mix in both specialty and core ingredients. These factors were offset predominantly by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic volume declines attributable to the sale of the company s Port Colborne, Canada, facility and macroeconomic headwinds in South America. Year-to-date net sales were up 1% to $2,815.3 million.

Second quarter reported and adjusted operating income were $198 million and $211 million, respectively. These were 15% and 17% increases, respectively, compared with $173 million of reported operating income in the second quarter of 2015 and $180 million of adjusted operating income.

Year-to-date 2016 reported and adjusted operating income were $398 million and $412 million, respectively. These were 28% and 22% increases, respectively, compared to $312 million of year-to-date 2015 reported operating income and $337 million of year-to-date 2015 adjusted operating income.

North America s second quarter operating income increased to $160 million from $127 million. Better price/product mix in specialty and core ingredients, cost synergies related to Ingredion s acquisition of Penford, as well as operational efficiencies driven by network optimization efforts accounted for the increase, the company said.

 I do think that in the North American consumer environment the drive has increased for these healthier ingredients by millennials and all parts of the population,  Ms. Gordon said.  And so we are very well positioned with our R.&D. and product development to develop those particular solutions.

 I think what you find in a mature economy, the ability to grow in the specialty products is increasing. I mean, even the desire for non-G.M.O. products is increasing. And so, we are one of the few companies that is able to supply those types of ingredients. We have been supplying non-G.M.O. type starches for over 10 years. 

Asked later in the call to expand on the G.M.O. labeling law that is in the works, Ms. Gordon said the law likely will help Ingredion s customers, particularly on the supply chain and packaging side.

 I think certainly we just supply what our customers want and don t particularly have a view on whether labeling is good or bad so to speak,  she said.  But we are there to supply what our customers want. And I think that the certainty for the consumer helps our customers and in terms of their supply chain. 

South America s operating income in the second quarter was $14 million, down $6 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflected lower volumes in the Southern Cone driven by macroeconomic headwinds, and higher costs for corn and other inputs.

Operating profit in Asia Pacific during the second quarter totaled $30 million, up $2 million from a year ago. The increase reflected volume growth and margin expansion that partially was offset by foreign exchange impacts.

Europe, Middle East and Africa s second-quarter operating income was $29 million, up $6 million from a year ago. Higher volumes and margin expansion more than offset foreign-exchange impacts.

Ingredion said its 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90, which compared with adjusted e.p.s. of $5.88 in 2015. The company said the guidance assumes overall improvement in North America, Asia Pacific and EMEA, and South America down slightly given the macroeconomic environment; an effective tax rate of 30% to 32%; and continued trade up in the company s portfolio.

In 2016, cash generated by operations is expected to be approximately $725 million to $775 million and $300 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be $300 million, Ingredion said.",FNB,FNB,"decline primarily reflected lower volumes,organic volume declines attributable,foreign currency exchange rates,demand on-trend products customized,network optimization efforts accounted,core ingredientsingredion earnings rise,increase reflected volume growth,quarter ended june 30 increased 10%,projecting operating income growth,north american consumer environment,year-to-date 2015 reported operating income,year-to-date 2015 adjusted operating income,quarter operating income increased,year ingredion posted earnings,foreign exchange impacts,second-quarter operating income,reported operating income,adjusted operating income,operational efficiencies driven,effective tax rate,southern cone driven,shareholder friendly action,chief executive officer,fuel organic growth,ingredion earnings rise,strong balance sheet,cost synergies related,favorable product mix,year-to-date net sales,north americanet sales,july 28 conference call,offset foreign-exchange impacts,25 ingredion idea labs,operating income,quarter totaled $30 million,year-to-date 2016 reported,network optimization,2016 adjusted earnings,net income,higher volumes,operating profit,consumer helps,macroeconomic environment,net sales,quarter reported,price/product mix,product development,strong quarter,cost structure,north america,north americawestchester,core ingredients,year ago,continued trade,offset predominantly,local tastes,innovation capabilities,port colborne,business model,mature economy,south america,positive trajectory,asia pacific,guidance assumes,margin expansion,macroeconomic headwinds,global footprint,cash generated,higher costs,momentum continues,improved price/mix,type starches,packaging side,middle east,common stock,strategic perspective,healthier ingredients,specialty products,supplying non-,capital expenditures,supply chain,specialty business,ilene gordon","labeling law that is in the works, Ms. Gordon said the law likely will help Ingredion s customers, particularly on the supply chain and packaging side.

28,Bunge filling gaps in global footprint,Company to start up operations at new flour mill in Brazil in September,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/International/2016/07/Bunge_filling_gaps_in_global_f.aspx?ID=%7B35DA4AD0-3E21-4C86-BC6A-4448A9608F23%7D,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 13:22:00 CST",International,"Bunge filling gaps in global footprintWHITE PLAINS, N.Y.   For Bunge Ltd., the past few years have been a continual stream of investments and joint ventures meant to expand the company s global footprint. More recently, the pace has picked up.

During a July 28 conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter results, Soren Schroder, chief executive officer of Bunge, said the company will start up its new flour mill in Rio de Janeiro, Spain, in September. Bunge first announced plans to build the mill in April 2014.

The construction of the mill is strategic. The states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo form one of the regions where the company is focusing its investments to modernize its operations, expand its production capacity and meet the needs of the growing market. Once operational, Bunge will have three of the largest mills in Latin America, strategically located in Fluminense, Suape and Ponta Grossa.

The new mill is expected to grind more than 600,000 tonnes of wheat per year.

Mr. Schroder said the new mill fits in nicely with the recently acquired Moinho Pacifico. Located in Santos, Brazil, Moinho Pacifico is one of the largest wheat flour millers in the country.

 (These moves) put us in a strong position to compete as the Brazilian market stabilizes,  Mr. Schroder said.  In Mexico and the U.S. our milling footprint is strong and diversified, and with the new product offerings we are well placed to grow earnings in our global milling segment. 

In addition to the flour mills in Brazil, Bunge earlier in the week said it is building on its joint venture with Amaggi in the country. The j.v., Unitapaj s, began in 2014, to operate on the route known as the Northern Corridor via the Tapaj s waterway in Brazil.

 Together we will share the export terminal at Barcarena and transshipment station in Miritituba to ensure the facilities operate at the highest levels of utilization and efficiency,  Mr. Schroder said.

Beyond Brazil, Bunge earlier this year inaugurated a crushing facility in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, and also sold 45% of its equity in its Vietnam crush operations to Wilmar, creating a three-party joint venture with Bunge and Wilmar as equal 45% shareholders and Quang Dung   a leading soybean meal distributor in Vietnam and majority owner of Green Feed, a growing Vietnamese feed milling business   retaining its existing 10% stake in the operations.

Bunge reported on July 28 that earnings for the second quarter of 2016 were $121 million, up 41% from $86 million in the same period of last year. Net sales, which declined for the eighth straight quarter, were down 2.2% to $10,541 million from $10,782 million in the same quarter a year earlier.

Higher Agribusiness results in the quarter were primarily due to improved performances in Grains, which benefited from strong growth in destination volumes and solid risk management, Bunge said. Earnings increased to $168 million from $164 million. Higher margins and volumes in Bunge s South American ports and services operations also contributed to the improved results. Grain origination in Brazil was an important contributor to the quarter. However, results were lower than last year due to slower farmer selling from the combination of market volatility and smaller-than-expected crops. Origination margins in both Argentina and the United States remained soft. Net sales in the Agribusiness segment were $7,524 million, down from $7,744 million in the same period a year ago.

In Oilseeds, strong meal and oil demand supported soy crush margins in Brazil and the United States, but were offset by lower results in Argentina crushing and weaker results in oilseed trading and merchandising. Canadian and European soft seed results remained weak, but the outlook for new crop margins improved. Second-quarter results included approximately $40 million of mark-to-market hedging gains related to oilseed processing, which are expected to largely reverse in the third quarter when the contracts are executed, Bunge said. Oilseeds earnings for the quarter fell 11% to $56 million from $63 million. Results in the quarter included a $12 million pre-tax impairment charge related to the remaining unamortized carrying value of certain patents. Results in the second quarter of 2015 included a $30 million pre-tax reversal of an export tax contingency in Argentina.

Earnings in the Milling Products segment increased to $33 million from $20 million. Bunge said all of its major businesses   Brazil and Mexico wheat milling and U.S. corn milling   reported earnings increases during the quarter. Net sales were $422 million, up from $409 million in the same period a year earlier.",FNB,FNB,"oil demand supported soy crush margins,european soft seed results remained weak,growing vietnamese feed milling business   retaining,$12 million pre-tax impairment charge related,corn milling   reported earnings increases,mark-to-market hedging gains related,second-quarter results included approximately $40 million,united states remained soft,leading soybean meal distributor,milling products segment increased,recently acquired moinho pacifico,largest wheat flour millers,discuss second-quarter results,global milling segment,remaining unamortized carrying,septemberbunge filling gaps,slower farmer selling,solid risk management,rio de janeiro,chief executive officer,south american ports,espirito santo form,joint ventures meant,$30 million pre-tax reversal,crop margins improved,export tax contingency,mexico wheat milling,global footprintwhite plains,brazilian market stabilizes,three-party joint venture,vietnam crush operations,july 28 conference call,higher agribusiness results,eighth straight quarter,bunge filling gaps,major businesses   brazil,growing market,green feed,moinho pacifico,milling footprint,higher margins,agribusiness segment,united states,origination margins,earnings increased,joint venture,largest mills,improved results,bunge reported,strong meal,weaker results,flour mills,export terminal,global footprint,global footprintcompany,market volatility,improved performances,grow earnings,lower results,quarter included,minas gerais,northern corridor,ponta grossa,crushing facility,latin america,largely reverse,oilseed trading,continual stream,majority owner,existing 10% stake,grain origination,flour mill,equal 45% shareholders,important contributor,net sales,primarily due,smaller-than-expected crops,oilseed processing,product offerings,highest levels,quang dung,announced plans,transshipment station,production capacity,strong position,strong growth,year inaugurated,year due,year earlier,year ago","Bunge filling gaps in global footprintCompany to start up operations at new flour mill in Brazil in SeptemberBunge filling gaps in global footprintWHITE PLAINS, N.Y.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

For Bret che, the acquisition brings the company a base of operations in North America for sales, technical support and aftermarket service. In addition to better serving existing customers, Bret che said it now will be able to expand its supply of complete dough make-up solutions in the North American market.

 As a global company, we have long wanted to increase our presence in North America,  said Didier Soumet, chief executive officer of the Bret che Group.  By acquiring Shick, not only will we have a strong base of operations in the United States to support our brands, but we will also have a partner that is closely tied to and aligned with the food industry there. 

Bret che Group s most well-known brands include mixing companies Diosna and VMI, as well as ingredient handling company Esteve. Shick and Esteve are expected to work together to enhance their ability to supply ingredient handling systems to a global customer base. The combined companies will operate manufacturing plants in North America and Europe and will implement both Rockwell and Siemens system control platforms, the companies said.

Shick Solutions  operating shareholders Joe, Mark and Matt Ungashick, all sons of founder William Ungashick, said they had no official plans to sell the business, yet when approached by Bret che, saw a great opportunity for the business by becoming part of the group. The acquisition provides mutual benefits in terms of technology, expertise, geography and culture for both companies.

 In Bret che Group, we saw a way to secure the future for our employees and the legacy of our company far beyond the family ownership of the company,  said Joe Ungashick, chief executive officer.

Mark and Matt Ungashick said they appreciate the small-company customer service-oriented culture within the Bret che Group.

 It was very important to us that the company be able to carry on its mission of delivering the ingredients for success to its customers, teammates and partners,  said Mark Ungashick, executive vice-president.

 I am excited about this opportunity as it enhances our pursuit of world-class practices in process solutions,  said Tim Cook, president of Shick Solutions.  Additionally, it will give us a platform from which we can continue to expand globally. Truly, this integration secures our future in the industry and allows us to better support the customers we serve.

30,Chipotle to open burger restaurant in Ohio,Tasty Made will be the Mexicanthemed chains first foray into the competitive premium burger space,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Business_News/2016/07/Chipotle_to_open_burger_restau.aspx?ID=%7B600FB197-D5F9-4D2F-B8DC-AF372C7FC1B5%7D,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 12:48:00 CST",Business News,"Chipotle to open burger restaurant in OhioDENVER   Ending months of speculation, Chipotle Mexican Grill confirmed plans to open Tasty Made, a restaurant specializing in premium hamburgers. The restaurant will open this fall in Lancaster, Ohio, and the menu will focus only on burgers, fresh-cut french fries, and milkshakes.

 Chipotle has been focused on a long-term vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food,  Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-chief executive officer of Chipotle, said in a statement.  At the heart of that is our commitment to great quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques   traits that are absolutely necessary to make the best tasting food, and that can be applied to a number of kinds of cuisine. 

Tasty Made will use Responsibly Raised brand beef, which indicates that the cattle are raised using humane handling practices and without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. The burgers will be served on buns free of preservatives, dough conditioners and other artificial ingredients. Also, milkshakes will be made using milk, cream, sugar, eggs and  other natural ingredients,  the company said.

The company hinted at the possibility of expanding into the premium burger space when it filed a trademark application in March for  Better Burger.  Tasty Made is the brain-child of Mr. Ells and two Chipotle staff members, Nate Appleman and David Chrisman.

Mr. Appleman, who joined Chipotle in 2010, is a 2009 James Beard award-winning chef with stints at San Francisco s A16, an Italian-themed eatery and the former Pulino s Bar and Pizzeria in New York, among other notable restaurants. Mr. Chrisman has spent 17 years at Chipotle, most recently as national training director, leading all training functions and new restaurant openings.

The Tasty Made venture comes as Chipotle Mexican Grill continues its recovery from a series of food safety mishaps that occurred last year. Some analysts covering the restaurant industry questioned the wisdom of opening a burger-centric restaurant given concerns associated with ground beef and E. coli.

 Early fast food burger restaurants generally had focused menus,  Mr. Ells said.  We think there s great strength in that original fast food model and wanted to create a restaurant built around that.

While net income more than doubled, sales as reported slipped 3%.

 H1 (sales) is showing a growth at 3.8% on a like-for-like basis and minus 3% on a reported basis, driven by unfavorable expected weakening currencies,  said Cecile Cabanis, chief financial officer of Paris-based Danone, in a July 28 earnings call.

Net income of  880 million ($975 million), or  1.43 ($1.58) per share on the common stock, was up 112% from  416 million, or  0.69 per share, in the first half of the previous fiscal year.

 (The results) are strong, and they do reflect the transformation of the company and, again, another quarter of progresses on our journey toward strong profitable and sustainable growth,  Ms. Cabanis said.

The exchange rates had a negative effect of 7.7% on sales. The effect reflected negative trends in currencies, including the Argentine peso, the Russian ruble, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.

Three of the four divisions within Groupe Danone reported volume growth in the first half with Waters up 5.9%, Early Life Nutrition up 1.6% and Medical Nutrition up 4.7%. Volume for Fresh Dairy Products slipped 2.1%.

Fresh Dairy Products reported first-half sales of  5,377 million ($5,995 million), down from  5,664 million in the first half of the previous year. Sales also fell for Water, to  2,393 million from  2,503 million. Sales rose for Early Life Nutrition, to  2,495 million from  2,445 million, and for Medical Nutrition, to  787 million from  780 million.

Geographically, the CIS and North America region reported first-half sales of  2,216 million, down from  2,305 million. Volume decreased by 3.3%.

Danone on July 7 said it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire WhiteWave Foods, Denver, in a transaction representing a total enterprise value of about $12.5 billion, including debt and certain other WhiteWave liabilities. Ms. Cabanis in the July 28 earnings call said Danone is preparing to file a proxy.

32,'Significant innovation' to launch from Hershey later this year,Company leveraging consumer insights to introduce new snackfection item,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2016/07/Significant_innovation_to_laun.aspx?ID=%7BFBD2FB09-78CA-4227-B6AC-1C2B907368D1%7D,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 12:11:00 CST",FinancialPerformance,"'Significant innovation' to launch from Hershey later this yearHERSHEY, PA.   The Hershey Co. is leveraging consumer insights to introduce an  exciting snackfection  item later this year, said John P. Bilbrey, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

 The feedback we ve received from consumers to date is that sweet snacking   think chocolate and textural ingredients as well as other food-value inclusions, such as nuts, seeds, cookie pieces, berries, etc.   are high-value components that are a gateway to permissible indulgence and sweet snacking throughout the day,  Mr. Bilbrey said during a July 28 earnings call with financial analysts.

 Snackfection  is a term coined by Hershey to describe products that blur the lines of traditional confectionery and snack items.

 Think salty snacks and confection, or other categories, cookies, and confection, etc.,  said Michele Buck, chief operating officer.

Earlier this year, Hershey filed to trademark the term  Hershey s Cookie Layer Crunch.  According to images leaked on-line, the new candy bar will feature milk chocolate packed with bits of shortbread cookie and caramel. Mr. Bilbrey referred to the fourth-quarter launch as  significant innovation,  and the company expects the product will bring new consumers to the category.

 Our most successful innovations are clearly grounded in deep consumer insights,  Ms. Buck said.  And we ve certainly leveraged a lot of insights and research as we ve developed this proposition and feel quite good about it ... If you think about the creamy, crunchy palate, sweet and salty we see in the marketplace has demonstrated a lot of growth. And we are seeing with younger consumers in particular there is strong interest in complex eats that this really delivers upon.

 That will provide incremental usage versus our portfolio, which tends to be more of a kind of straight creamy palate. So if you think about the textural experiences consumers are looking for and the new users that we re able to bring in, we re feeling really good about it. 

Innovation contributed to quarterly sales and earnings performance that exceeded the company s expectations, Mr. Bilbrey said. Net income in the second quarter ended July 3 was $145,956,000, equal to 70c per share on the common stock, which compared with a loss of $99,941,000 in the year-ago period. Net sales increased 3.7% to $1,637,671,000 from $1,578,825,000. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, net sales increased 4.5%. The acquisition of the barkThins brand during the quarter helped results.

 Over the last four to five years, we had good confectionery success,  he said.  Some products over-delivered versus our expectations and are still doing well today. And some of the new items from last year have under-delivered with lower volumes than we modeled. While innovation is hard work, our best innovation has been tied to consumer insights coming from our demand landscape work and leveraged across big brands and platforms and driven by our go-to-market capability. 

Recent successes include KitKat BigKat, Reese s Snack Mix and Hershey s Snack Bites, he said, adding  and we re also excited about the Reese s Pieces Cup, which will only be available as an instant consumable item. Demand from retailers has been double our planning. Product began shipping earlier this month and is available in stores now. 

Regarding Hershey s approach to innovation, Mr. Bilbrey said it s more about productivity than pace.

 When you look at things like hand-to-mouth that we were very successful with and it continues to be productive for us, it s what I always call  sticky innovation,   he said.  It s innovation that lasts, it s many times a platform, and it allows you then to expand even across brands because you ve identified a need state that is really important.

 If you look at how we classify innovation, actually our numbers versus our innovation targets are actually pretty good this year. I mean it is not that they are widely different, but what you have to really achieve is that stickiness, and the thing that gets you to the platform innovation. So we have a really good pipeline of things in front of us.

 I don t think it s about all of the sudden having to start focusing against innovation. It s really making sure that we re bringing the right innovation to the market with the right investment and productivity. 

Net income in the six months ended July 3 was $375,788,000, equal to $1.79 per share on the common stock, up from $144,796,000, or 67c per share, in the same period of the prior year.

33,Whole Foods may enter meal kit market,Retailer posted 26 decline in comparable store sales in the third quarter,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2016/07/Whole_Foods_may_enter_meal_kit.aspx?ID=%7BD6C8A8B0-1B97-49C0-8F57-0350275035FC%7D,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 16:12:00 CST",FinancialPerformance,"Whole Foods may enter meal kit marketAUSTIN, TEXAS   Is meal kit delivery in Whole Foods  future? Maybe. Executives of Austin-based Whole Foods Market, Inc. hinted at potential participation in the burgeoning, $1.5 billion category.

 It s part of what we re looking at with what we call our  meal solution spectrum,  which we re really excited about because it s going to address all aspects in which we want to bring food to our customers,  said Ken Meyer, executive vice-president of operations, during a July 27 earnings call with financial analysts.  We obviously study and see all the trends out there around how that s changing, and we know that we have a long history of leading in the food culinary side. We re going to continue that with what we re doing around looking at the option of meal solutions and the ways in which we want to do that. We re not going to announce anything today, but we will say that we re committed to this category. And we think we have a good strategy for it. It will be revealed. 

Leading the effort is Tien Ho, a veteran of the restaurant and hospitality industry, who recently was hired in the newly created role of global vice-president of culinary and hospitality at Whole Foods.

 For the first time in the history of the company (we) have a world-class person from the restaurant hospitality business reporting directly to David (Lannon, executive vice-president of operations) and Ken that s crafted this roadmap for this group,  said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer.  We re going to have a lot to say about this area. 

The move into meal kits would represent one of many initiatives Whole Foods Market has considered or executed recently to remain competitive as mainstream retailers offer more natural and organic options.

 There s a lot more competitors in the marketplace,  said John Mackey, co-c.e.o.  There s a lot of new formats in the marketplace from home meal replacement through meal kits, fast casual restaurant growth, more entrants in the natural and organic food space, the mainstreaming of natural and organic, which has been well reported. These are all factors. Whole Foods Market being the leader having very high sales per square foot, we probably feel the brunt of it as there s a bit of a regression to the mean. As we lose customers from a convenience standpoint.

 People don t drive as far as they used to drive because   there s good enough alternatives in many cases close by to them. So, people may not be driving as frequently as far as they used to because they can stop by a Kroger or an H-E-B or a Wegman s to get products that they used to only be able to get at Whole Foods. Now, there s some overlap in our product base from other competitors. I think there s no sense in denying it. Competition is bigger, and we re responding to it as we think in an intelligent measured way, and we still remain very bullish about our future prospects. 

In the third quarter ended July 3, Whole Foods net income was $120 million, equal to 37c per share on the common stock, down from $154 million, or 43c per share, in the prior-year period. Sales increased to $3,703 million from $3,632 million.

Comparable store sales declined 2.6%. During the quarter, Whole Foods Market opened 12 new stores, including the first 365 by Whole Foods Market location, the company s smaller-format value concept.

 As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our produce price investments and launched weekly, deep discount promotions in several categories,  Mr. Robb said.  We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers, and highlighted our quality differences.

 We produced a 45-basis-point improvement in comps from last quarter, as a significant improvement in items per basket more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories, and customers trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item.

 While our value strategies continued to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based lift in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments, particularly produce. 

Another initiative under way at Whole Foods is the testing of imperfect fruit in California stores.

 Given the broader focus on food waste in the world, I think this is one of the really proactive, responsive ideas around how to respond to that,  Mr. Robb said.  See how it turns out.

Restaurant Brands International Inc. has established a master franchise joint venture company, TH Coffee Services Philippines Corp., with a group of investors in the Philippines. The new company will be the master franchisee of the Tim Hortons brand in the Philippines and marks the coffee chain s entrance into Southeast Asia.

 This agreement signals an exciting era of growth for the Tim Hortons brand internationally and particularly in Southeast Asia,  said Daniel Schwartz, chief executive officer of Restaurant Brands International.  The master franchise joint venture model has been a successful strategy for the Burger King brand and we expect it will continue to help us drive growth and build scale for the Tim Hortons brand over the long term. 

Elias Diaz Sese, president of Tim Hortons, said the initiative is part of the company s move to expand its global footprint beyond its primary markets of Canada and the United States.

 We are working with partners who have a deep understanding of the Philippines, which we believe will position them well for success in developing and growing the brand in the region,  Mr. Diaz Sese said.

The development agreement entered into with the joint venture company is the most recent by Restaurant Brands in its plans to develop and grow the Tim Hortons brand internationally.

 While there s still a great deal of work to do, the team has diligently focused on the components of brand messaging and execution in local markets,  Mr. Ellen said during a July 27 earnings call with financial analysts.  Supporting this is a deep inspection of pricing, packaging, channel, and geographic competitive trends alongside those of 7UP. These insights should enable us to begin implementing certain changes in the balance of 2016. There s definitely more to come on 7UP. 

Despite 7UP s souring sales trends, Dr Pepper Snapple posted a solid second quarter, with bottler case sales up 1%, carbonated soft drink volumes up 1% and non-carbonated beverages up 2%.

Net income in the quarter ended June 30 was $260 million, equal to $1.40 per share on the common stock, up 18% from $220 million, or $1.15 per share, in the prior-year period. Net sales increased 2.4% to $1,695 million from $1,655 million. Sales volume increased 1%.

While Diet Dr Pepper declined during the quarter, it continues to  significantly outperform  the category, declining at about half the rate of all diet carbonated soft drinks, said Larry Young, president and chief executive officer.

He added that consumers who switch away from diet soft drinks may be opting for some of the allied brands in Dr Pepper Snapple s portfolio, such as Bai, Vita Coco and Fiji.

 We re outperforming the category, but I don t think we re losing consumers,  Mr. Young said.  If you look at our broad portfolio, especially with our allied brands, we have some people going over to some of our allied brands, some of our better-for-you, some of the diet brands in there 

 If you break the diet category down, there s (companies) losing much more of the volume. I think we re going to get it. But I still think some of our consumers as we continue our insights, we re not losing them. Their switchers are going to other brands and we re keeping them in our portfolio. 

Net income in the six months ended June 30 was $442 million, or $2.37 per share on the common stock, up 17% from $377 million, or $1.96, in the same period of the previous year. Net sales were $3,182 million, up 2.4% from $3,106 million.

 We continue to expect reported net sales to be up approximately 2% inclusive of a foreign currency translation headwind of about 1%,  Mr. Ellen said.

Mondelez International, Inc. plans to enter China s $2.8 billion chocolate market with the launch of its Milka brand this fall. Despite the country s recent economic woes, China  will continue to be an important part of our growth story,  said Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, during a July 27 earnings call with financial analysts.

 By leveraging a formidable power brand like Milka in a sizable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards,  Ms. Rosenfeld said.  We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility, and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category.

 While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we are well-positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and will enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season. 

During the conference call, Ms. Rosenfeld confirmed the company s offer to acquire the Hershey Co., which was rejected in late June; however she declined to share details related to the matter. Still, she addressed an analyst s question regarding Hershey s recent struggles in the Chinese chocolate market and why Milka may be better positioned to succeed.

 With respect to chocolate in China, we have studied this for quite some time,  Ms. Rosenfeld said.  The Chinese consumers love brands with personality. We ve done a lot of testing with the consumer, and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle. The purity of Alpine milk together with some of the assets that you re familiar with, the Lila Cow, for example, are really positive with the Chinese consumer, and we have every expectation that we can actually bring growth back to this market with the launch of Milka. 

Within China, e-commerce represents a particularly attractive opportunity for Mondelez, which earlier this year inked a deal with Alibaba Group, the country s leading e-commerce company, to sell snacks on its Tmall.com platform.

 China is an important market for us,  Ms. Rosenfeld said.  We have some of the most attractive gross margins in that market of any of the emerging markets in the world, but there is no question that the economy has weakened and that s contributed to slower growth of our categories. So we have continued to selectively invest in marketing support in our power brands, and in particular e-commerce, as the fastest growth in e-commerce is occurring in China.

 We actually see close to 10% of snacks being purchased on-line, and it is one of the drivers of the partnership that we have struck with Alibaba. So we really believe that the strong programming we have on our core franchises, biscuits and gum, together with the launch of China, will help us continue the momentum in that market. 

Near term, she added, the company remains cautious of China s weakened economy but maintains confidence in long-term opportunities.

Net earnings attributable to Mondelez International in the second quarter ended June 30 were $464 million, equal to 30c per share on the common stock, which was up 14% from $406 million, or 25c, in the prior-year period. Net revenues fell nearly 18% to $6,302 million from $7,661 million. The decline in revenue was driven by the deconsolidation of the company s coffee business and its Venezuela operations, and currency headwinds. Organic net revenue grew 1.5%, helped by pricing actions and increased consumption of Oreo, belVita and Triscuit products in North America.

Net earnings in the six months ended June 30 were $1,018 million, or 65c per share, up 40% from $730 million, or 45c, in the same period of the previous year. Net revenues declined 17% to $12,757 million from $15,423 million.

 We've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%,  said Brian Gladden, executive vice-president and chief financial officer.  This reflects the increasing challenges we re seeing in global categories, and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions. We continue to expect adjusted (operating income) margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment.

Various mechanical differentiation operations on a combination of grains, including oat grains and gluten-containing grains, allow the oat grains to have gluten levels below 20 parts per million (p.p.m.), preferably 10 p.p.m.

The gluten-free oats then may be used in a range of gluten-free oat food products, including cereal and granola products, according to the patent US 2016/0207048 A1. U.S. federal government rules require products labeled as gluten-free to have a maximum gluten level of 20 p.p.m.

Various mechanical differentiation operations in the patent include width grading steps, multiple length grading steps, aspirating steps and a potential de-bearding step. Using mechanical separation techniques may be effective at a low cost. The patent does not include optical systems, which generally employ multiple cameras and are associated with higher costs.

While oats do not contain gluten, oats cultivated in North America, Europe and other parts of the world commonly are contaminated by gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale, according to the General Mills patent. The contamination may come from rotating grain crops on the same land as well as from harvesting, transporting, storing and merchandising.

General Mills experienced problems with wheat contamination of gluten-free products last year. The company recalled several days of production of gluten-free Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios at its Lodi, Calif., plant.

38,Delivery the 'Usain Bolt of initiatives' at Panera,Ceo references Olympic sprinter in describing delivery initiatives power and speed,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2016/07/Delivery_the_Usain_Bolt_of_ini.aspx?ID=%7BA05BD3FF-016E-4AAB-8441-194CB4165630%7D,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 12:00:00 CST",FinancialPerformance,"Delivery the 'Usain Bolt of initiatives' at PaneraST. LOUIS   For Panera Bread Co., delivery always was part of the plan. But what the St. Louis-based company has found over the past four years of prototyping and testing in multiple forms is that Panera is  perfectly suited for mass-market delivery. 

 Panera can offer a high self-esteem fast casual alternative to the low-end Asian and pizza offerings now flooding the delivery market,  Ron Shaich, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Panera, told analysts during a July 27 conference call to discuss second-quarter financial results.  Indeed, we see a whitespace in delivery options for healthful high-quality salads, sandwiches, and soups. The fact is, delivery is a powerful initiative, and it will make a huge difference at Panera. It represents a significant sales layer. Indeed, delivery sales six months after roll-out approach approximately 5,000 per week on average. 

Mr. Shaich said Panera s research has shown that delivery grows at a rate significantly faster than its eat-in and to-go business. Another benefit is that start-up costs for delivery at Panera are modest, primarily relegated to hiring costs. Panera only accepts digital orders for delivery, which fits in nicely with the e-commerce capabilities built for Panera 2.0. All in all, delivery has quickly become a  powerful profit generator  for Panera, Mr. Shaich said.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016 Panera launched delivery in 52 company-owned bakery cafes, bringing the total number of company bakery cafes offering delivery to 122. Additionally, delivery is now available in 73 franchise bakery cafes across seven franchise groups. Approximately 10% of Panera s system is offering delivery, Mr. Shaich said, which is ahead of the company s delivery roll-out goal for 2016. As a result, the company has raised its goal for delivery to 15% of the system by the end of 2016.

Describing delivery, Mr. Shaich, who has utilized running metaphors in the past, made the comparison to a sprint.

 We ve come to believe delivery is the Usain Bolt (Jamaican Olympic sprinter) of initiatives at Panera,  he said.  It s powerful, it moves very quickly, and it is getting out of the blocks fast. What else have we learned about delivery? We learned that over time, our sales will continue to grow in delivery as awareness goes up. Our profits will go up significantly with delivery as we generate more sales per cafe and thereby lower cost per delivery. And the effectiveness of our delivery operations will get better and economically more efficient as we gain more experience, implement new technological capabilities, and most importantly, move down the learning curve. 

Mr. Shaich said Panera s confidence in the power of delivery continues to strengthen as the company puts more markets in operation for longer periods of time and gains more robust data. Panera s ownership isn t the only one excited about delivery; so, too, are the company s franchisees, he said.

 Sam Covelli, owner and operator of our largest franchise group, Covelli Enterprises, has been operating delivery out of 10 of his bakery cafes for the past three months,  Mr. Shaich said.  He told us last week that he is seeing double-digit increases at those bakery cafes and that the customers have never been more excited. He went on to tell me that he has never been more excited; for this reason, he s working to quickly put in place the physical and managerial capabilities needed so we can accelerate the roll-out of delivery to his other units. 

Net income at Panera in the second quarter ended June 28 was $34,501,000, equal to $1.46 per share on the common stock, down 18% from $41,929,000, or $1.60 per share, in the same period a year ago. Revenues increased 3% to $698,900,000 from $676,657,000.

For the six months ended June 28, net income totaled $69,589,000, or $2.92 per share, down 6% from $73,789,000, or $2.80 per share, in the same period a year ago.

39,Coca-Cola cuts revenue forecast,Weakness in developing markets pressured results in second quarter,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2016/07/CocaCola_cuts_revenue_forecast.aspx?ID=%7BD3879406-7954-4FBC-A303-A70211A1474E%7D,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 12:00:00 CST",FinancialPerformance,"Coca-Cola cuts revenue forecastATLANTA   The Coca-Cola Co. lowered its forecast for full-year organic revenue growth to 3% from its previous target of 4% to 5%, after consolidated volume and revenue results came in below expectations in the recent quarter.

Net income attributable to shareowners of Coca-Cola in the second quarter ended July 1 was $3,448 million, equal to 79c per share on the common stock, up 11% from $3,108 million, or 71c, in the prior-year period. Net operating revenues declined 5% to $11,539 million from $12,156 million. The decline was driven by challenging macroeconomic conditions, structural changes and foreign exchange headwinds, the company said. Organic net revenue increased 3%, reflecting solid performance in developed markets offset by weakness in emerging and developing markets, including China and Argentina.

 Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges,  said James Quincey, president and chief operating officer, during a July 27 earnings call with financial analysts.  Our ability to grow doesn t require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we re using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback.

 But we re also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. 

Net income attributable to shareowners of Coca-Cola for the six months ended July 1 was $4,931 million, or $1.13 per share, up 6% from $4,665 million, or $1.06, in the same period of the prior year. Net operating revenues for the period declined 5% to $21,821 million from $22,867 million.

Coca-Cola remains on track to complete its refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer.

 Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions, announced the transfer of certain territories of the United States to Arca Continental United Venture, and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning,  Mr. Kent said.  As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company, with higher margins and returns, and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets.

40,Unlocking growth in prepared meals,The key may lie in the phenomenal success of the meal kit delivery market says Mintel,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Business_News/2016/07/Unlocking_growth_in_prepared_m.aspx?ID=%7B86BE0091-D88C-45D9-8C02-17791C8A01AB%7D,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 15:43:00 CST",Business News,"Unlocking growth in prepared mealsCHICAGO   Sales of prepared meals have become stagnant as a result of changing consumer perceptions and behaviors, said John Owen, senior food and drink analyst for Mintel, Chicago. The key to unlocking growth in the category may lie in the success of meal kit delivery, which has burgeoned into a $1.5 billion market over the past several years.

 This phenomenon is appealing to the same trends that prepared meals need to answer to,  Mr. Owen said during a presentation at the Institute of Food Technologists  annual meeting and food exposition held July 16-19 in Chicago.

Twenty-one per cent of adults and 40% of millennials said they have tried meal kit delivery services, driven by the need for convenience, an interest in exploring cuisines and eating fresh, and a lack of expertise in cooking, Mr. Owen said.

Meanwhile, nearly half of consumers surveyed by Mintel who eat frozen or refrigerated meals or side dishes said these options are quicker than preparing food from scratch and are handy when they don t want to cook. A third said they like the taste of prepared meals, and a quarter of consumers said the category offers a wide variety of cuisine options.

One of the biggest hurdles manufacturers of prepared meals must overcome is consumer perception of products as  too processed,  Mr. Owen said.

 More than a third of consumers say all natural ingredients would convince them to purchase prepared meals more often,  Mr. Owen said.  Two thirds say they would eat more prepared meals if they were less processed. 

Consumers are more likely to buy prepared meals with a  no additives or preservatives  claim on the package, he said.

While sales of such stalwarts as Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice and Banquet have plummeted in the past five years, brands perceived as fresher and healthier with more flavor variety have persevered. Amy s Kitchen, Evol, Luvo, P.F. Chang s and Innovasion all posted double-digit growth last year.

To succeed going forward, manufacturers of prepared meals must continue to align with changing attitudes about food while looking for opportunities to create an advantage in the marketplace, Mr. Owen said.

As the line between meals and snacks continues to blur, products positioned as a snack or side dish may capture new usage occasions. An example from Nestle USA is Stouffer s Cups, which are single-serve portions of lasagna or macaroni and cheese varieties packaged in handheld cups. Evol, a business unit of Pinnacle Foods, offers a similar line of products.

 Brands like Stouffer s and Evol are using package and portion size to move prepared meals farther down that line to the middle ground of meal and snack,  Mr. Owen said.

Another example is Devour, a new line of frozen entrees from the Kraft Heinz Co., that is  not based on meals but on cravings,  Mr. Owen said. Featuring such varieties as chicken and waffles, white cheddar macaroni and cheese with bacon, and angus beef and corn bread, Devour offers a twist on traditional comfort food and rates favorably among millennial men surveyed by Mintel.

Products that address specific health and lifestyle needs or enable customization may also deliver a much-needed boost to the category, Mr. Owen said.

 We think there is room on the spectrum from completely prepared meals to cooking from scratch for prepared meals to move in the direction of cooking and creativity, whether it s mixing and matching or creating your own meals with components to have that same kind of ownership,  Mr. Owen said.",FNB,FNB,"food exposition held july 16-19,food technologists  annual meeting,meal kit delivery services,meal kit delivery market,move prepared meals farther,meal kit delivery,address specific health,traditional comfort food,millennial men surveyed,posted double-digit growth,changing consumer perceptions,biggest hurdles manufacturers,white cheddar macaroni,purchase prepared meals,buy prepared meals,completely prepared meals,prepared mealschicago   sales,prepared mealsthe key,cheese varieties packaged,5 billion market,senior food,preparing food,prepared meals,consumer perception,changing attitudes,mintelunlocking growth,unlocking growth,refrigerated meals,healthy choice,lean cuisine,drink analyst,rates favorably,frozen entrees,pinnacle foods,side dishes,side dish,much-needed boost,wide variety,eating fresh,natural ingredients,snacks continues,usage occasions,single-serve portions,corn bread,nestle usa,portion size,middle ground,enable customization,kraft heinz,business unit,exploring cuisines,angus beef,preservatives  claim,flavor variety,consumers surveyed,handheld cups,eat frozen,phenomenal success,brands perceived,cuisine options,similar line,products positioned,devour offers,john owen,category offers,meal,food,move,meals,macaroni,key,cheese,manufacturers,sales,varieties,offers,success","This phenomenon is appealing to the same trends that prepared meals need to answer to,  Mr. Owen said during a presentation at the Institute of Food Technologists  annual meeting and food exposition held July 16-19 in Chicago.

WhiteWave already has fulfilled its 2016 commitment to source 100% sustainable cocoa powder for its North American brands, including Silk, So Delicious, Vega, Horizon and International Delight products. The company now has extended the same commitment to its Alpro brand, which it plans to have converted to 100% sustainable cocoa powder by the end of 2017. WhiteWave also pledged to reduce sugar in Alpro products by 12.5% by 2020.

WhiteWave currently sources 100% certified sustainable palm oil for its liquid creamer products. By 2020, the company plans to have its entire palm oil supply comply with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (R.S.P.O.) NEXT criteria, which seeks to prevent deforestation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve human rights conditions associated with palm oil production.

Since WhiteWave started tracking its environmental impact in 2006, the company said it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 32% per lb of product. In the past two years, WhiteWave has reduced water use by 6% per lb of product and waste to landfill resource intensity by 52%. In 2014-15, WhiteWave s Earthbound Farm brand recycled nearly 9,300 tons of food waste, the report said, including 98% of all lettuce culls. By 2025, Whitewave said it will further reduce energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and waste to landfill per lb of product by 20% from its 2013 baseline.

 At WhiteWave, we aim to produce great-tasting food in a way that s better for people, our communities and our planet,  said Gregg Engles, chairman and chief executive officer of WhiteWave Foods.  To achieve this goal, we are constantly seeking new ways to deliver the transparency, choice and responsible practices people are looking for today.

The review will include a thorough evaluation of Inventure s current operating plan and may result in the company continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, capital structure optimization, a sale of the company, a sale of certain assets of the company or other business combination.

Inventure said it has established a committee of three independent directors to oversee the review, and the company has retained Rothschild as its financial adviser and DLA Piper LLP (US) as its legal adviser to assist in this process.

 The board of directors is committed to increasing shareholder value,  said David L. Meyers, chairman of Inventure.  We determined after careful consideration that this is an appropriate time to undertake a comprehensive strategic and financial review of the business. While the review is ongoing, the company will remain focused on delivering improved financial performance by continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. 

Inventure operates manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Indiana, Washington, Oregon and Georgia. The company is a marketer and manufacturer of specialty food brands in better-for-you and indulgent categories under a variety of company owned and licensed brand names, including Boulder Canyon Foods, Jamba, Seattle s Best Coffee, Rader Farms, TGI Fridays, Nathan s Famous, Vidalia Brands, Poore Brothers, Tato Skins, Willamette Valley Fruit Co., Fresh Frozen, Bob s Texas Style and Sin In A Tin.

In addition to announcing the strategic and financial review, Inventure released its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The company narrowed its loss in the second quarter ended June 25 to $278,000 from $1,951,000 in the same period a year ago. Net revenues in the second quarter increased 4% to $69,263,000 from $66,422,000.

 We remain focused on the operational and financial improvement of our business,  said Terry McDaniel, chief executive officer.  During the second quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives with another quarter of sequential improvement in gross margin, which contributed to a $1.1 million increase in EBITDA, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. 

Net revenues in the company s Snack Products segment fell 13% in the second quarter to $27.5 million, primarily as a result of a reduction of products the company makes for third parties and decreased Boulder Canyon sales due to capacity constraints, a shortage of organic potatoes caused by weather, and slotting investments. Gross profit in the segment held steady year over year at $5.4 million, Inventure said, and as a percentage of net revenues increased 250 basis points to 19.7%, which compared with 17.2% in the prior year period.

In the Frozen Product segment net revenues increased 20% to $41.8 million, which compared with $34.9 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit was $4.8 million, up from $2.6 million in the prior year period.

Overall, for the six months ended June 25 Inventure sustained a loss of $1,296,000, which compared with a loss of $16,586,000 in the same period a year ago.

Although pleased with earnings that increased nearly 10% during the third quarter, J&J Snack Foods Corp. was disappointed with a lack of sales growth during the period, said the company s top executive.

 Well, we certainly want to be better than what we are   far be it for me to say we didn t exactly want to crow about earnings, which was significant, because they were up 10% for the quarter, but I am not happy with and our team is not happy with the sales growth in the third quarter,  Gerald Shreiber, president and chief executive officer, said during a July 26 conference call with analysts.  However   and it s too early to say   sometimes you get into a flat period; and then, sometimes, it s ignited. For example, the hot weather that we ve really been having, I think that has ignited some things on our beverage and our frozen things that we ll look at in the fourth quarter. 

In the third quarter ended June 25 net income was $26,791,000, equal to $1.44 per share on the common stock, up from $24,462,000, or $1.31 per share, in the same period a year ago. Net sales eased to $277,981,000 from $278,724,000.

Operating income in the company s Retail Supermarket business fell 34% to $4,266,000 from $6,406,000, while sales in the division declined 10% to $37,013,000 from $41,128,000.

 Sales of soft pretzels in our retail supermarkets segment continue to be weak as our SuperPretzel Bavarian bread items were discontinued,  Mr. Shreiber said.  They were launched a year ago. However, we did see some improvement this quarter. Frozen juices and ices were down 11% in the quarter, as we had increased trade spending to introduce the Whole Fruit organic juice tubes and the new Philly Swirl products. Although Philly Swirl products  decline continued, we expect improvement in the fourth quarter. Handheld sales in retail supermarkets declined due to decreased volume and increased trade spending for the introduction of the Pillsbury mini dessert pies. 

One product that Mr. Shreiber said J&J Snack expects more from going forward is Oreo Churros. The roll-out has taken a little longer than expected, and as a result the product thus far has failed to gain traction.

 One of the reasons (for the delay was) midway through the launch, we made a change in a design and the filling of a cream,  he explained.  Really, we want to kick ourselves because we couldn t get   and we have a terrific partner, Mondelez   with it. We couldn t get that on board early. Now, the product comes with a cream already inside it and we re expecting not a strong quarter, (but rather) a very, very strong quarter in quarter four. 

J&J Snack fared better in its Food Service segment, where operating income during the third quarter increased 20%, to $24,619,000 from $20,479,000, and sales rose 1%, to $169,148,000 from $167,248,000.

 Sales of soft pretzels in food service improved this quarter as sales to restaurant chains rebounded,  Mr. Shreiber explained.  They were up 13% as we had sales of $1.2 million to one chain under an L.T.O., limited-time offer program. Sales to schools also improved this quarter. Handheld sales and food service continued to be strong, led by sales to two customers. Churros sales were up 6% as sales were strong across the board.

 Our whole grain funnel cake product has been well received in schools and contributed significantly to our sales growth in this quarter and for the nine months. We also had sales of $3.8 million to our new restaurant chain customer. However, we do not expect additional funnel cakes sales to this company in the near future.

 Bakery sales were down 6% as sales were down $4.4 million to one customer as that customer added a secondary supplier. We expect sales to this customer to be down about $1 million a month through January 2017 and then it should flatten up with decent comps. Additionally, cookie sales to school customers were down this quarter, as we shed some low-margin business. 

During the conference call, Mr. Shreiber expanded on the loss of business with the bakery customer. He said J&J Snack did not receive much lead time that the potential loss of business was in the works.

 This was in the wind and this is a terrific customer,  he said.  They have been a customer for years and we make a cookie product for them and we make it very, very well and we were the sole supplier. They put together a project that they did want to have a sole supplier on this at all, and finally, they worked with somebody and they wound up taking a sizable portion of the business from them   I say roughly 20% to 25%.   It took them a year to implement it but now it s affected our sales volume, probably a lot more than it affected our bottom line because our margins were indeed tight and the commodity factor was weighted to any kind of increases up or down in a couple of critical ingredients and components. The relationship with the customer is still good, I would say very, very good. And yes, we re looking to do what we can to replace that business. 

For the nine months ended June 25, net income at J&J Snack Foods totaled $55,357,000, or $2.97 per share, up 10% from $50,355,000, or $2.70 per share, from the same period a year ago.

44,"Yes, Campbell will have a new soup line",The soups featuring such ingredients as kale and quinoa will launch in January,http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/New-Product-Launches/2016/07/Yes_Campbell_will_have_a_new_s.aspx?ID=%7B83AEDCEF-6665-4293-A267-79F007D09146%7D,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 12:46:00 CST",NewProductLaunches,"Yes, Campbell will have a new soup lineCAMDEN, N.J.   The Campbell Soup Co. in January plans to launch Well Yes, a new soup line that will feature such ingredients as kale and quinoa. The new soup will seek to invigorate sales in the company s Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment, which reported a 3% drop in sales in the third quarter ended May 1.

 We have work to do on soup and beverages,  said Mark R. Alexander, president, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, in a July 20 investors  day call.  Sales of ready-to-serve soups have not met our expectations, and we ve seen declines on our V8 brand. 

A group of women who work at Campbell Soup Co. came up with the idea for Well Yes ready-to-serve soup.

 They love soup, of course, and they work here but felt the category lacked a product specifically for them, a brand that stood for something they could connect with and one that used ingredients they wanted more of like kale, quinoa and lean protein,  Mr. Alexander said.  So they created a soup that they wanted to buy and one that would disrupt the soup aisle, but they didn t do it alone. They invited a group of consumers who felt the same way. Together they co-created the brand. 

The group worked with company chefs, product developers and marketers to create the soup.

 And they worked fast,  Mr. Alexander said.  This platform had been slated for a fiscal 2018 launch, but they created a compelling idea and challenged the way that we traditionally launch products, and we accelerated our plans and are bringing it to market six months early. Well Yes will launch in January 2017 and feature popular soup recipes with a decidedly contemporary twist. 

The name Well Yes fits with a company  yes, yes  list. Campbell is saying yes to more vegetables and yes to more whole grains, said Denise M. Morrison, president and chief executive officer of Camden-based Campbell Soup Co.

Mr. Alexander gave updates on other soup brands. In the premium segment, Slow Kettle grew 10% in retail sales over the past year.

 Built around a promise of patience, not preservatives, Slow Kettle features restaurant-inspired recipes and clean ingredients,  Mr. Alexander said.  This emerging brand has attracted new consumers, strong repeat purchase rates and has great potential. We will strengthen awareness of Slow Kettle through dedicated support as part of our portfolio advertising campaign. 

Campbell also will expand distribution of Campbell s organic soup, which launched in August 2015.

A new integrated marketing campaign for Chunky brand soup will seek to connect with men in a new way.

 The role of men in American family life is shifting,   Mr. Alexander said.  Modern males are no longer constrained by traditional definitions, and our Chunky men are no different. During the past year we ve developed a deeper understanding of our Chunky fans. Between their jobs, families and personal interests, they feel they are juggling more responsibilities than ever. They work hard and are proud of their achievements whether it s on the sidelines of a peewee football game or the aisles of a grocery store.

 Our new advertising campaign reflects this reality and recognizes the everyman for everything he does with adulation usually reserved for NFL stars. 

Advertising and in-store marketing for condensed soup will highlight such examples as the pairing of a bowl of tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich or the comfort of a chicken noodle soup. The campaign will focus on cooking and one-dish dinners.

Turning to shelf-stable juices, Campbell Soup started selling a V8 Protein line of shakes in September 2014 and then discontinued the line a little more than a year later.

 However, these drinks strayed from our key point of difference, vegetable goodness, and played in highly competitive new spaces,  Mr. Alexander said.  As a result they largely haven t worked. Moving forward we will stabilize the brand by refocusing on our unique vegetable positioning. 

Campbell Soup under its V8 brand will continue to support Veggie Blends and address declines in V-Fusion and Splash.

 Lastly, we will continue to grow V8 +Energy and particularly the new sparkling energy range,  he said.  This brand continues to perform strongly as consumers, especially young parents, choose our blends of pleasant natural juices and green tea over stronger artificial tasting energy drinks. We will invest in building distribution, in-store activation and targeted digital and mainstream advertising to capitalize on the brand s strong double-digit growth. 

Plum Organics, a line of organic baby food, grew 25% over the past year and delivered $119 million in retail sales, he said.

 Plum is a brand loved by millennial parents,  Mr. Alexander said.  It connects with them personally and meaningfully through vibrant digital communities of parents and parenting experts. 

Within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Campbell has a plan with four priorities, he said. One is to improve performance in soup and beverage categories while continuing to drive growth in Simple Meals. The second priority is to connect with consumers to build relevance and drive demand. The third one is to expand availability across multiple retail channels, and the fourth one is to drive margin expansion.",FNB,FNB,"stronger artificial tasting energy drinks,slow kettle features restaurant-inspired recipes,july 20 investors  day call,strong repeat purchase rates,soup linethe soups featuring,feature popular soup recipes,campbell soup started selling,sparkling energy range,american family life,strong double-digit growth,grilled cheese sandwich,decidedly contemporary twist,peewee football game,chief executive officer,slow kettle grew 10%,vibrant digital communities,grow v8 +energy,pleasant natural juices,americas simple meals,unique vegetable positioning,organic baby food,drive margin expansion,multiple retail channels,chicken noodle soup,integrated marketing campaign,advertising campaign reflects,portfolio advertising campaign,traditionally launch products,support veggie blends,alexander gave updates,camden-based campbell soup,v8 protein line,slow kettle,chunky brand soup,drinks strayed,simple meals,ready-to-serve soups,drive growth,organic soup,dedicated support,targeted digital,shelf-stable juices,in-store marketing,lean protein,vegetable goodness,drive demand,chunky fans,mainstream advertising,v8 brand,love soup,soup linecamden,ready-to-serve soup,soup brands,condensed soup,soup aisle,tomato soup,green tea,nfl stars,premium segment,key point,product specifically,perform strongly,grocery store,moving forward,building distribution,longer constrained,improve performance,modern males,category lacked,one-dish dinners,expand distribution,personal interests,parenting experts,strengthen awareness,deeper understanding,build relevance,great potential,beverage categories,highly competitive,in-store activation,expand availability,product developers,months early,traditional definitions,delivered $119 million,largely haven,quarter ended,retail sales,soup line,campbell soup,past year,brand loved,emerging brand,brand continues,young parents,chunky men,millennial parents,worked fast,fiscal 2018 launch,invigorate sales,plum organics,address declines,compelling idea,ve developed,company chefs",The campaign will focus on cooking and one-dish dinners.

This was a major undertaking, with the Ishida's project team having to empty the pack house and re-install the three existing lines together with new steelwork and conveyors and the new line. To maximise space and efficiency, the team introduced a workable product flow with all product entering the area from one end and leaving it packed at the other.

Three weighing and bagging lines are grouped in a line at the far end of the pack house, while a conveyor takes product packed into punnets from Ishida's multihead weigher to the packing area where all packs are boxed and placed onto pallets.

To keep disruption to a minimum, nine days were originally allowed for the pack house's transformation, utilising the quieter periods over two weekends. However, the Ishida team was able to complete the task in just five days with production able to start up early.

Zenith's managing director Franco Barone said: ""This is typical of the support I have received from Ishida over the years.

""It is one of the reasons why I will only deal with Ishida when it comes to the weighing side of our operation.""

The latest Ishida salad weigher to be installed is a 14 head 5l salad specification model, which features Ishida's recently-developed easy-motion material, which helps keep salad leaves moving through the weigher. All of the company's weighers are easy to set up, and changeovers between product or pack sizes can be carried out at the touch of a button on the machines' remote control units.

Zenith also implements rigorous hygiene standards and the ease of cleaning of the weighers helps to minimise the downtime for this operation.

With Zenith operating up to 14 hours a day seven days a week, the reliability of the weighers is another important factor.

Franco says: ""I can be pretty certain that the Ishidas will not let me down.

""This is very important as we would certainly struggle if one line was out of commission for any length of time.""

One of the most impressive factors in Zenith's success is that the company's expansion has been entirely self-funded. Not surprisingly, this means that every investment in new equipment is very carefully considered.

Franco adds: ""There is no point buying the cheapest machine if its lack of reliability means it is not working for half the time.

""Service support and back-up in the event of a problem are also essential.

""And the quality of the equipment and the high levels of service are the reasons why we continue to partner with Ishida.""",FNB,FNB,"14 head 5l salad specification model,implements rigorous hygiene standards,managing director franco barone,conveyor takes product packed,latest ishida salad weigher,ishida re-designs production lines,salad leaves moving,food processing technologyishida,recently-developed easy-motion material,remote control units,workable product flow,existing lines,bagging lines,product entering,multihead weigher,franco adds,features ishida,ishida team,originally allowed,maximise space,high levels,production line,project manager,pack house,carefully considered,quieter periods,team introduced,project team,major undertaking,pack houseishida,pack sizes,cheapest machine,impressive factors,point buying,complete re-design,important factor,entire operation,packing area,weighing side,zenith operating,reliability means,service support,weighers helps,production,packed,product,franco,weigher,ishida,complete,helps,means,service,operation,reliability,weighing,area,support,important,line","Zenith's managing director Franco Barone said: ""This is typical of the support I have received from Ishida over the years.

We can advise you on improvements to your plant that will oft...",http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/contractors/thermal_processing/spirax-sarco/,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 23:00:00 GMT",,"Spirax Sarco - Solutions for Steam Systems in the Food and Beverage Industries - Food Processing TechnologySpirax Sarco has 100 years' expertise in providing steam system solutions across all industries, including the food and beverage sectors. We can advise you on improvements to your plant that will often result in dramatic cost savings, improved production rates and lower fuel usage, which will lower your emissions footprint while increasing profits.

Blanching, peeling, cooking, coating, distillation, evaporation, pasteurisation, dehydration, extrusion, shrink wrapping - steam plays a part in a large number of food processes, from preparation and processing to preservation and packaging. Few familiar food brands reach the consumer without steam playing some part in their manufacture.

Below are just a few of the many products and systems that we currently supply to the food and beverage industries.

The BT6 316L stainless-steel balanced-pressure steam trap is specifically designed for hygienic applications including steam barriers, CIP / SIP and process vessel drainage, sterilisers and autoclaves, and culinary steam mains drainage. The body is crevice-free, self draining and available with a surface finish of up to 0.4 m. A high-capacity version is available.

Balanced-pressure thermostatic steam traps adjust automatically to varying steam pressures. They offer excellent air venting characteristics during plant start-up and during normal operation, and have large discharge capacities for their size. The robust design of the internals gives a good life expectancy.

The STERI-TROL is a pneumatically actuated two-port angle-pattern clean service control valve suitable for a wide range of applications in the food, brewing and beverage industries. We offer a comprehensive selection of control valves to meet every application, including:

The EasiHeat? compact steam heat-exchange unit covers a wide range of domestic and process hot water duties from 110kW to 1,800kW. The skid-mounted core unit, which occupies only 1.2m  of space, incorporates precisely matched components based around an Alfa Laval TS6M plate heat exchanger.

Steam heat-exchange units allow heat to pass from a primary heat source to a secondary fluid without direct contact; the two main steam-to-water types are 'shell and tube' and 'plate' heat exchangers.

The FTS14 is an austenitic stainless-steel ball float steam trap with an integral automatic air vent suitable for use on steam systems up to 14bar. The trap offers excellent corrosion resistance and a positive aesthetic appearance. It is suitable for sterilisers, autoclaves, process vessels and heat exchangers.

The FTS14 ball float steam trap is compact and versatile, and can work efficiently on both light and heavy condensate loads. Its discharge capacity is high and continuous, ensuring maximum heat transfer. An integral air vent is fitted as standard and a steam lock release is an option.

The Spirax Sarco direct in-line variable area flowmeter (DIVA) has been designed as an ideal system for any steam energy management scheme or steam flowmetering application, from monitoring and targeting initiatives to control applications. The low-cost integrated unit offers high turndown and simple digital commissioning without the need for additional equipment or DP transmitters.

Process condensate is an important source of energy, water and boiler chemical savings. The condensate contamination detection (CCD) system monitors the conductivity of condensate being returned to the boiler and diverts contaminated condensate to a drain.

Spirax Sarco provides world-class system audits, on-site product analysis and, if necessary, repairs commissioning, trouble shooting and steam boiler turnkey project management.

Within the food and beverage industry, the key to finding the best automation solution is a thorough analysis of each individual part of the plant or installation.

By carrying out an in-depth analysis of the application, it can be determined if a centralised control system using non-intelligent nodes, will deliver the required performance, or if the sheer size of the system means that the control has to be decentralised, using a fieldbus system working with field controls, intelligent valves and actuators.

The company also plans to introduce its other confectionary products and access the China's growing demand for chocolate.

The development is expected to enhance and accelerate the company s growth plan.

Mondelez International chief growth officer Tim Cofer said:  When we launched our growth plan last year, we said we'd focus on geographic white spaces where we could accelerate the growth of our core categories and power brands.

 This is a perfect example of that plan in action,  launching a snacking category where we're already a world leader into an emerging market where we have an established, successful presence.

 We see enormous potential for the growth of the chocolate category in China, where consumption today is low, even by emerging market standards.

 We expect our industry-leading innovation, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities to attract more consumers, more often, growing our business and the category. 

Mondelez International is reported to be one of the world's largest chocolate companies, with a portfolio of iconic brands that include Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, C te d'Or, Lacta and Toblerone.

""We've been operating in China for over 30 years so we know this market and what it takes to launch a business here.""

Hershley currently has a presence in the China, which saw a 3% decline in chocolate confectionery sales last year, reported Reuters.

The grant was awarded by the councils in partnership with a consortium of 13 major food and drink companies.

The research outcomes will assist food and drink companies in developing new products that address diet-related health issues in the longer term.

 All have the potential to produce important results that could deliver real benefit to the health and wellbeing of consumers in the UK and around the world. 

BBSRC Innovation and Skills interim executive director Karen Lewis said:  The projects recommended for funding through this round of the Diet and Health Research Industry Club (DRINC) will contribute to addressing issues relevant both to consumer health and the food and drink industry.

 We are pleased that the projects will investigate a diverse range of topics that explore the link between diet and health. The DRINC community is well-placed to ensure the results of these studies can be translated into benefits for society. 

The projects will focus on new ways to reduce levels of sodium in foods, resistant starches in pre-prepared food, the availability of nutrients in wheat, and the influence of iron on the microbiome.

HAAS Marketing Communication and Public Relations Manager Irene Kapaun recently visited Nairobi to report on the project's progress.

In Korogocho, the streets are choked with garbage and there is no sewage system. During periods of rainfall, the entire area is flooded and wastewater flows through the provisional barracks. Water is expensive, scarce, and frequently polluted.

Irene Kapaun explained: ""We want to help create a future worth living for Korogocho's children"".

Active measures against child malnutrition include the establishment of an integrated training bakery at a local school. HAAS supports the bread and education for a better future project, which ensures children are not only offered a nutritious meal every day, but also an education enabling them to provide for themselves as adults.

Within the project, 98 children in primary schools are cared for. In addition to one hot meal every day, children are provided with fresh fruit and basic medical care.

The project's team helps children regain a normal life with structured daily routines. A special rehabilitation program helps drug addicted children and the school offers psycho-social support, being a sort of home and a secure space.

Irene added: ""The measures have changed their lives dramatically: They have found their self-esteem, they have new hope for the future.""

Once the children finish school, they can enrol in apprenticeship courses to become bakers. A European master baker trains the young students in collaboration with African bakers.

Irene points out: ""In these two-year courses students learn the basic skills of the bakery trade and after graduation, they are well equipped to find employment or to open their own businesses. Well trained professionals are still hard to find in Nairobi.

""A lack of education results in a lack of self-confidence and courage. Adults who are well-trained and educated will become self-sufficient and able to lead independent lives. With the financial support of bread and education for a better future, we are helping to give the children in the slums of Nairobi an education and an opportunity to learn a promising profession.""

Ardagh originally challenged the students on the packaging design course to create  a futuristic ready-to-heat premium metal packaging concept for food and seafood. One of their designs was a cheese fondue bowl, which was presented to Emmi. In close cooporation with DeDutch, a food packaging and engineering consultant, Ardagh further developed the concept to meet Emmi s requirements.

The product has since been launched at high-end supermarkets in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.

Ardagh Group chief commercial officer, metal Woep M ller said:  We developed this exclusive microwaveable shaped bowl at our R&D centre in Crosmieres, France, with our innovative prototyping and design techniques and utilising our extensive knowledge and experience in lacquering and printing performance.

 Together with Emmi and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, we tested special food safe lacquers to allow the bowl to be heated either in a microwave or a traditional oven, and to be kept at the right temperature above a candle at the table. We added our patented printed Easy Peel aluminium opening solution that gives the consumer an easy and quicker means of opening the bowl. 

The business case for Emmi was clear. Marcel Zbinden, global category head speciality cheese, added:  Convenience and quick preparation have become a more important trend. This concept has it all, and it will delight fondue lovers worldwide.

The Cold Press No.1 squeezes fruit more gently than other juicing methods. Fruit and vegetable juice is extracted without crushing the cells too much or creating undesirable heat, meaning that the machine works with nature rather than working against it.

The equipment is capable of pressing up to 100 litres of juice every hour, is hydraulic manuel operated, constructed from stainless steel materials and designed according to EHEDG and CE guidelines. With optional separate grinder and pump and filler available, the machine comes with three filter bags and one bucket included.

And the shelf life of cold pressed juices can be extended from a few days to a few weeks without the need for heating or high pressure processing, by utilising the PurePulse PEF technology.

Glasgow-based R-Biopharm Rh ne has introduced a robust new smart analyser called Rida Cube Scan which, when used in conjunction with enzymatic tests, detects organic acids, sugars and sulphite in wine, which are indicators of a wine s quality.

The test kit portfolio is being marketed to the drinks safety sector at a time when the UK has retained its place as the sixth biggest wine consumer in the world, and amid an anticipating increase in wine consumption worldwide.

R-Biopharm Rh ne product specialist Joanna Wilkie said:  The Rida Cube Scan is a walk-away instrument that allows automated single-testing. The first tests available for use on this system have been specifically developed with the wine industry in mind.

 All data specific for the test are stored on the RFID card, so there is no need to enter any instrument or application settings. Results are calculated automatically, displayed on the screen and can be exported to a personal computer or a laboratory information management system. 

Wilkie added that one of the great attractions of the Rida Cube Scan is its size: though small enough to sit in a desktop, its innovative technology makes precise testing possible and it contains the functionalities of larger laboratory systems.

80,Young food start-ups in India,Jessica Gay takes a look at four exciting start-ups from India's booming food-tech industry   from apps to coffee concepts.,http://www.foodbev.com/news/four-young-food-start-ups-in-india/,"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 08:13:25 +0000",Food,"Young food start-ups in IndiaThe food-tech industry in India is booming. With key players such as FoodPanda leading the revolution, India has experienced a huge surge of start-ups bursting to get a piece of the market. Investors are seeing the worth in this boom and are investing heavily in food-tech start-ups, particularly those in the food delivery sector. Earlier this year, a young food delivery start up, Yumist, received $1m from Orios Venture Partners, whilst another, Bueno, received $600k from an undisclosed angel investor.

Despite this boom, we ve decided to explore some of the start-ups trying to do something a little bit different. We ve identified four young start-ups that have identified their own gap in the market and are working hard to build a successful company in India s ever-evolving food and beverage sector.

Based in Bangalore, this start up began whilst its founder, Shubra Acharya, was at university. Her artisan chocolate company allows the customer to customise their own bars, from chocolate type, flavours and toppings   essentially allowing them to play  chocolatier . Gaining a strong following from B2B clients, including those from India s top IT firms and large car showrooms, the start-up has experienced strong growth since launching in 2014. Whilst already achieving a strong presence throughout India, Happiness Bars  next plan is to gain an international audience throughout the B2B sector.

The concept for Dropkaffe came when its founders decided that the standard of office coffee was poor. The four founders came up with a plan to bring great-tasting, freshly brewed coffee to busy office workers, offering them quality, affordability and accessibility. Already live in five locations across Bangalore, the team s plan is to set up six more centres in the area by the end of the year and progress into developing cold beverages. Fulfilling around 300 orders a day, DropKaffe s growth rate means the team is expecting to reach 1,000 orders a day in the next couple of months. Another major focus for the team is packaging. Believing India still lags behind when it comes to packaging, they are working on addressing solutions for issues such as, spillage and insulation.

Inspired by the health and fitness craze in the US, two young sisters started up Yoga Bars in order to bring the  healthy  snack bar craze to India. Seeing a gap in the market for a quality, natural snack, they launched their company in August 2014. Unlike its competitors, Yoga Bars differentiates itself by being 100% natural, without the addition of corn starch, additives or added vitamins. The company is already experiencing a great amount of success and through a mixture of offline stockists and online selling, since starting, its product sales have risen from 2,000 to 20,000!

Unlike its competitors, Quinto is a food app, designed by a team in Maharashtra, which has been developed to suit the evolved restaurant diner. Rather than just helping diners discover new restaurants, Quinto uses a system of crowdsourcing to create a personalised food recommendation engine which helps its users discover the best food options. Each dish has a star rating, and the users are able to make an informed decision on the restaurant or meal based on the rating and feedback. Whilst the app is currently in beta testing mode, the team have high hopes for success since receiving an undisclosed amount of funding from the founder of the restaurant chain Faaso s earlier this year.",FNB,FNB,"personalised food recommendation engine,healthy  snack bar craze,young food delivery start,toppings   essentially allowing,orios venture partners,indiajessica gay takes,beta testing mode,large car showrooms,developing cold beverages,young sisters started,growth rate means,food delivery sector,indiathe food-tech industry,undisclosed angel investor,busy office workers,helping diners discover,evolved restaurant diner,restaurant chain faaso,freshly brewed coffee,young food start-ups,booming food-tech industry,yoga bars differentiates,artisan chocolate company,experienced strong growth,young start-ups,fitness craze,food options,ever-evolving food,office coffee,food-tech start-ups,undisclosed amount,chocolate type,yoga bars,natural snack,food app,beverage sector,b2b sector,coffee concepts,exciting start-ups,start-ups bursting,foodpanda leading,b2b clients,product sales,informed decision,play  chocolatier,investing heavily,happiness bars,huge surge,major focus,online selling,corn starch,received $1m,key players,high hopes,international audience,added vitamins,addressing solutions,offline stockists,great amount,strong presence,ve decided,received $600k,shubra acharya,users discover,successful company,working hard,ve identified,meal based,star rating,founders decided,bring great-tasting,began whilst,believing india,start,restaurant,start-ups,experienced,booming,strong,bars","Investors are seeing the worth in this boom and are investing heavily in food-tech start-ups, particularly those in the food delivery sector.

According to the organisation:  The benefits of glass packaging for health, taste, and quality are endless and, safe to say, timeless. Glass as a packaging material has been used since 1,200 BC and has taken man through the ages. Now, the recipe for glass will join man on to the next frontier, space.

Lunar Mission One has recently launched an ambitious new campaign  Footsteps on the Moon  which aims to put a digital archive containing millions of human footprints on the Moon in 2017. Inspired by Buzz Aldrin s iconic boot print image,  Footsteps on the Moon  is an opportunity for everyone in the world to upload a picture of their own   or someone they love s   footprints, and store it on the Moon for millions of years. Simply take a photo, and upload it for free here: www.lunarmissionone.com/ footsteps.

 The moon belongs to everyone, and every single one of us has the right to make our mark on its surface   digitally of course,  said David Iron, Founder of Lunar Mission One.  It might be your new born baby s feet, your footsteps on the beach during your honeymoon, or you and your best friends  high heels on a night out. Whatever your story is,  Footsteps on the Moon  is all about capturing the moment and adding it to a digital archive of human life. 

 By sending glass to the moon, we are preserving a fundamental piece of human history that has been in use for millennia,  added Michael Delle Selve, senior communications manager for FEVE.  Glass is definitely the packaging of today and the future. It is the safest packaging material for health, best preserves the quality of food and drink and is 100% indefinitely recyclable, why wouldn t glass be one of mankind s greatest footprints?

83,Arla banned from selling skyr in Finland,Arla is no longer allowed to sell dairy products under the name  skyr  in Finland.,http://www.foodbev.com/news/arla-banned-from-selling-skyr-in-finland/,"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:28:27 +0000",Dairy,"Arla banned from selling skyr in FinlandArla is no longer allowed to sell dairy products under the name  skyr  in Finland.

The Swedish company has been selling products labelled skyr in Finland for some time, marketing them as  the Icelandic super yogurt . According to the Reykjav k newspaper Morgunbla i , this has frustrated the Icelandic dairy MS Iceland Dairies, which claims exclusive rights to skyr   claiming  skyr  was not a product type but a specific trademark.

Arla was given one week to remove any skyr products from shelves, as Finnish courts ruled that skyr is a trademark owned by MS. According to the court all dairy products sold as skyr in Finland have to be produced by MS, according to an MS recipe. But the product does not have to be manufactured in Iceland.

Before the lawsuit, MS Iceland Dairies produced an advertisement poking fun at Arla s Skyr. In the video, a tub of Arla Skyr is seen struggling to understand Icelandic and mispronouncing the word skyr, while MS Iceland Dairies  product is heard calling it  yogurt posing as skyr .

Despite MS having registered skyr as a trademark in Norway and Finland, it is simply the name of a traditional Icelandic dairy product, similar to yogurt but made with whey. Skyr existed for hundreds of years before MS began marketing it and is manufactured and marketed by other dairies in Iceland. Nor is skyr a registered trademark anywhere other than Finland and Norway   a fact Arla has exploited, capitalising on the success of the popular Icelandic treat and selling it as  Icelandic super yogurt  in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.",FNB,FNB,"icelandic dairy ms iceland dairies,traditional icelandic dairy product,ms iceland dairies  product,ms iceland dairies produced,selling products labelled skyr,dairy products sold,sell dairy products,popular icelandic treat,finnish courts ruled,claims exclusive rights,advertisement poking fun,icelandic super yogurt,ms began marketing,skyr   claiming  skyr,understand icelandic,skyr products,product type,ms recipe,yogurt posing,selling skyr,swedish company,heard calling,newspaper morgunbla,longer allowed,skyr existed,word skyr,registered skyr,registered trademark,trademark owned,specific trademark,fact arla,arla banned,dairies,arla skyr","According to the Reykjav k newspaper Morgunbla i , this has frustrated the Icelandic dairy MS Iceland Dairies, which claims exclusive rights to skyr   claiming  skyr  was not a product type but a specific trademark.

84,"Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic bar","Fruit d'Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry's first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.",http://www.foodbev.com/news/fruit-dor-launches-pro-cran-the-first-cranberry-probiotic-bar/,"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:24:27 +0000",Food,"Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic barIn an attempt to showcase the benefits   and product versatility   of Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder, Fruit d Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry s first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.

The bar features Cran Naturelle blended with protein, prebiotics and probiotics for digestive health and overall well-being,  which literally raises the bar for cranberry beyond UTI,  said Stephen Lukawski, director of global sales and development for Fruit d Or.

The Pro Cran probiotic bar was developed as a prototype to showcase the benefits of using Fruit d Or s cranberry seed powder in the food industry. Bars remain a top choice for healthy foods on the go.

The cranberry seed contains a potent oil that is cold-pressed; the  leftover  seed meal is then dried and milled under a proprietary process to maintain the integrity of the cranberry seed with no degradation, Lukawski explained.  After conducting a finger print analysis we were able to determine that the cranberry seed is rich in fibre and contains at least 20% protein. What makes the tasty Pro Cran bar novel is that the prebiotic in the bar is derived from the cranberry seed and the probiotic is a strain called Bacillus coagulans; the cranberry seed powder and Bacillus coagulans is currently marketed as an ingredient called Lacto Cran. 

Lukawski reports that in a probiotic study by Sabinsa Corp. (East Windsor, NJ and Payson, UT) Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder   developed exclusively for food and beverage applications   was compared against FOS (fructooligosaccharides) and inulin. Test results demonstrated that the cranberry seed generated  200% more activity growth for the BC strain over FOS or inulin.

 The cranberry seed acts as a nutritious food for the probiotic strain. It s most likely that the cranberry seed provides a carbon and nitrogen source that fuels the growth of the strain. In addition the cranberry seed contains other important attributes such as 16 essential amino acids, fatty acids and at least 2% PAC content. 

Lukawski notes that he used the Bacillus strain from Sabinsa because of its ability to ensure the cultures survive the baking temperatures needed to produce the Pro Cran bar.  As a result the cultures remain stable and active through to the last bite. 

Each Pro Cran bar delivers 2 billion CFU probiotic cultures, contains 4g of cranberry seed powder and 12 grams of protein. Enjoying two bars daily provides a good source of fibre and protein. The Pro Cran bar is coated in vanilla yogurt and is low in calories and sugar.

Pro Cran was conceived and developed by Lukawski, who has a lengthy list of unique nutra-foods to his credit, including:  antioxidant-rich pretzels, pizza flour and bread; omega 3, 6, 9 pretzels, cranberry protein pretzels, grape skin pretzels and bread, chia fibre pretzels and bread, cranberry protein and fiber bread, cranberry pizza flour, chia seed pizza flour, probiotic/vitamin C/cranberry gum for oral health, PS and cranberry cognitive health bar, and more.

 The philosophy of Pro Cran is very simple:  people prefer foods to pills in order to obtain nutraceutical benefits,  Lukawski comments.  Foods that are tasty, convenient, portable and that provide the specific sought-after health benefits will have sustained high sales velocity.

POW Energy Water brings the qualities of water to the energy drink category. Made with natural ingredients POW is a low sugar, low calorie sparkling fruit-flavored energy water. With only 1.6 grams of sugar per 100 ml and less than 50 calories per 440 ml bottle, POW Energy Water offers consumers real choice in functional drinks. It is the first natural energy water to be launched in the UK and Ireland.

Clondalkin has produced three variants of the sleeve for three different flavors: cranberry and apple, coconut and lime and citrus and zest. Recyclability and the environment is important to POW Energy and the move to a 100 percent recyclable sleeve with a stronger recycling message on is a great step towards having a sustainable packaging strategy.

Ken Dunlop, sales manager for Clondalkin Flexible Packaging Bury, comments: ""It's always exciting to be involved in a new product launch. The sleeve design is simple, yet striking and complements the product inside.""

89,Breakfast foods: not just for morning anymore," 
	Consumers continue to embrace snacking &ndash; not only as viable daypart option, but also as a paradigm through which to view eating in general (smaller, more frequent meals).&nbsp; ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89007-is-it-breakfast-or-a-snack,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400",,"Breakfast foods: not just for morning anymoreConsumers continue to embrace snacking not only as viable daypart option but also as a paradigm through which to view eating in general (smaller, more frequent meals). This has caused and will continue to cause changes in consumers' relationships with traditional breakfast foods, according to market research publisher Packaged Facts in the report, ""Breakfast: Retail Market Trends and Opportunities in the U.S.""

""As restaurant brands such as Denny's have long known, and as McDonald's success with all-day breakfast cements, foods traditionally associated with the breakfast daypart can also find success during other parts of the day and/or as a snack,"" says David Sprinkle, research director, Packaged Facts.

Embracing snacking as a breakfast option is clearly important: roughly one quarter (24%) of consumers often snack in the morning instead of having a full meal. The tendency to snack for breakfast is most pronounced among younger adults and those with children in the household, and they should be targeted accordingly.

 Long associated with snacking (thanks in part to single-serve packaging that promises portability and small portions) and the ease with which it can be incorporating it into a variety of meals as a major ingredient (yogurt, granola and fruit; yogurt-based smoothies; etc.) yogurt straddles breakfast and snacking. Some 39% of adults eat yogurt as a snack, while 44% eat yogurt for breakfast.

But other foods closely associated with breakfast have also made their way into the snacking realm, such as bacon (43% for breakfast versus 16% as a snack), cold cereal (55% versus 25%) and even pancakes/French toast (33% to 13%). For many, comparatively low snacking usage penetration suggests that snack-based growth opportunities may still exist, given the proper alignment of packaging, portability, and preparation requirements. One company that realized this, for example, was Kellogg's. As part of a company initiative to narrow the gap in the single-serve snack food opportunity, Kellogg's put some of its cereals in grab-and-go cups, including Frosted Flakes with Energy Clusters, Special K Protein, Froot Loops Bloopers and Special K granola. Additionally, the company launched Kellogg's To Go Breakfast Mix, a cereal mix packaged in single-serve pouches and made to be enjoyed without milk. The cereal pieces are made with snacking in mind and are larger than traditional cereal pieces. The resealable pouch is designed to fit in a car's cup holder.

The new design meant moving away from their traditional paper labels to transparent OPP wrap-around labels.

The new bottle incorporated pronounced linear markings and contoured edges. Working to accentuate the new bottle, Constantia developed a customized label with contoured edges. Standard, reel-fed OPP labels have a rectangular format, compelling Constantia to explore various technical solutions in order to bring the vision to life.

Pic-N-Place technology is a step higher than the company's Soft-Catch product handling system. Pic-N-Place takes the Soft-Catch lift table and adds precision lifting and lowering of product with a proprietary technology that eliminates breakage. With speeds of up to 20 cycles per minute and a heavy-duty stainless steel tubular frame, the packer is designed to operate 24/7 and is suited for both partitioned and partitionless RSC case packing. Standard-Knapp's robust, 2-axis, servo-controlled delta robot provides precision control of two cases of product throughout the entire Pic-N-Place motion. The machine packs to the last case without the need for any operator intervention.

Multiple product types and sizes are easily changed over with the user-friendly HMI touch-screen panel and adjustable lowering heads. The lowering heads are module and easily changed to accommodate even greater product variation with the same precise control.

93,Color spotlight: Why so blue?," 
	Blue is everywhere and universally loved. Ask people their favorite color and chances are they&rsquo;ll pick blue.&nbsp; ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89005-color-spotlight-why-so-blue,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 13:40:55 -0400",,"Color spotlight: Why so blue?Blue is everywhere and universally loved. Ask people their favorite color and chances are they ll pick blue (though men tend to prefer it more than women. No, it's not obvious   blue was considered softer and more suited to girls until around World War II and some parents were still dressing Junior in pink as late as the 1980s.) Experts who study color psychology tell us blue signifies openness and tranquility, stability and confidence, intelligence and faith.It s part of our language, symbolically and emotionally.

In the business world, blue says: Trust me.Respect me. You can believe in what I m offering you. It s the most commonly used color for corporate identity. Think Ford, Disney, IBM, HBO and Facebook. It conveys authority without seeming threatening. The deeper the blue, the greater the clout. Wear that dark blue business suit when you want to land a job or secure a raise. But be careful driving home: Sorry officer, I didn t realize I was speeding.

Not bad for a hue that was apparently invisible for most of human history.

Do you see what I see?

Blue was never really invisible. Physically   scientifically   our eyes can perceive blue. On the spectrum of visible light, blue falls between violet and green with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers. Higher frequency blues have a shorter wavelength and gradually fade into violet; those with lower, longer wavelengths eventually look greener. Right in the middle, pure blue clocks in at 470 nanometers.

Language, not physiology, is what blinded our forebears to blue. In his epic work  The Odyssey,  Homer looked at the sea and described it as  wine-dark.  The oddity puzzled William Gladstone (a prime minister more than once under Queen Victoria), who started counting the color references in Homer and other Greek texts. Guess what he found: no blue. He thought the peculiarity was limited to the Greeks, but a few years later, Lazarus Geiger, a philologist (someone who studies language in written historical sources) broadened the research and discovered that no ancient works made reference to blue.

So he started looking at when names for color appeared. Black and white (or light and dark) showed up first in every language he studied, followed shortly by red. Yellow and green were next. The last color   in every language   was blue. The Himba people of Namibia still have no word that distinguishes between blue and green and can t perceive differences that would be glaringly obvious to most of us.

The exception was the ancient Egyptians, who possessed the technology to produce a blue dye. They also used lapis lazuli for the eyebrows of King Tut s funeral mask.

Woad you look at that?

Early dyeing techniques   and a flowering plant called woad, a member of the mustard family   may have helped elevate blue as a concept and make it possible for people to finally  see  it. The Celts were using woad for body paint in Roman times. By the Middle Ages, the poor were wearing woad-dyed clothing. The nobility, secure in their red and purple, paid little attention to poor, neglected blue.

Everything changed between 1130 and 1140 when Abbe (or Abbot) Suger, a French statesman, churchman, historian and early patron of Gothic architecture, rebuilt the Basilica of St. Denis in Paris and installed stained glass windows colored with cobalt. Combined with the light from the red glass, the cobalt gave the interior of the church a bluish hue. People marveled.

Twelfth-century artists also changed how the Virgin Mary was depicted, throwing out her dark, somber robes and replacing them with blue ones, which soon became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.

Once blue found the spotlight, it never left. Woad eventually gave way to indigo, which fell to synthetic indigo, which finally was replaced by other synthetic dyes. Through it all, blue gained in popularity. Dark blue became the color of military uniforms and, in 1829, of the London Metropolitan Police; bobbies these days wear a lighter blue. The New York City police department adopted blue uniforms in the 1840s.

Though we think of people who do manual labor as blue collar, we also believe blue means business. The modern blue business suit has its roots in 17th-century London. After the plague of 1665 and the great fire of 1666, King Charles II ordered his courtiers to simplify their wardrobes and their color palettes. Blue, gray, white and buff became the rage among London merchants and English country gentlemen, and the colors still dominate menswear style today.

What color is the sky?

We perceive the sky as blue because air scatters short-wavelength light. Blue, which is on the short end of the visible spectrum, becomes more dispersed in the atmosphere. The result is that our eyes see blue when we look up into a sunlit sky. We see the sea as blue for the same reason. Sorry, Homer.

95,Saint Arnold's coffee porter is a shot (of espresso) to the senses," 
	When someone orders a shot and a beer, they typically aren't referring to a shot of espresso. The latest release from Saint Arnold Brewing Co. could change that.&nbsp; ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89001-saint-arnolds-coffee-porter-is-a-shot-of-espresso-to-the-senses,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400",,"Saint Arnold's coffee porter is a shot (of espresso) to the sensesWhen someone orders a shot and a beer, they typically aren't referring to a shot of espresso. The latest release from Saint Arnold Brewing Co., the oldest craft brewery in Texas, could change that. Saint Arnold Icon Blue - Coffee Porter was brewed using 45 lbs. of espresso beans, which contribute to the beer's balance of chocolate, roast and coffee flavors and its pleasant roast aroma with a mix of chocolate, coffee and mocha.

Saint Arnold Icon Blue - Coffee Porter is beginning to appear on tap and in six-packs of 12-oz bottles as supplies of Saint Arnold Icon Red   American Roggenbier run out. From this point forward, beers in the Saint Arnold Icon Series will be available in six-packs.

Craft beer and specialty coffee are kindred spirits. Both require roasting and rely on aroma to enhance the overall experience. Both are enjoyed by passionate communities of people who appreciate bold, distinct flavors and the two beverages share many flavor similarities. In fact, some stouts and porters can elicit the aromas and flavors of coffee even when no coffee is used. That was never an option for Saint Arnold Icon Blue - Coffee Porter, however.

 

 ""We have been working with Houston-based specialty coffee roaster Java Pura for quite a while on various ideas for new beers and this one came together beautifully,"" says Saint Arnold brewer Eddie Gutierrez. ""We tried a half-dozen different types of coffee and decided Java Pura's Espresso Blend really enhanced the beer's flavor. We also tested different methods of adding the coffee beans and everyone agreed that adding it to the fermenter after the beer is completed   similar to dry hopping or dry spicing   gave us the results we were after.""

While this is Saint Arnold's first publicly released beer using Java Pura's coffee beans, this isn't the first time the two companies have collaborated. Java Pura uses recycled oak barrels from Saint Arnold's Bishop's Barrel Series to age green coffee beans prior to roasting. The idea led to the creation of Java Pura's own Barrel Aged Series of coffee beans.

100,Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger filler," 
	Many of today's newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88996-integrating-a-form-fill-seal-bag-machine-with-an-auger-filler,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400",,"Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger fillerNew designs in food packaging are constantly being developed and introduced to consumers. While these new trends are sharp and eye-catching, product nevertheless needs to get inside   and that can be tricky at times with smaller openings and different packaging sizes.

Many of these newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. For food manufacturers and packagers, these machines are a major purchase that can take months to accurately specify, quote, build and deliver. The process can become easier by improving communication between the vendors and customer early in the design stages. This will make that process a much quicker and smoother experience for everyone involved   and deliver an FFS machine that s ready for action the first day it s installed.

One of the main components of the design process is the integration of the VFFS machine to an auger filler. These two pieces of equipment need to be in-sync with one another to properly deliver the desired performance for the customer s application.

To get started, the vendors and customer need to share basic information with each other including:

Knowing this information upfront helps vendors determine the scope of the project. It also allows the auger filler supplier to determine if the customer s desired performance specifications for the application can be achieved.

The reason to have answers to these questions in the early stages is that each one influences the other; if one of the answers to a question is unknown, it can change the scope of the project.

The size and shape of the forming tube is one of the most important pieces of information a filler vendor needs in designing a system to integrate with an FFS machine. The amount and speed of which the product can be filled depends largely on the diameter of the auger, and that is dictated by the diameter and shape of the forming tube.

Simple physics comes into play in determining the fill rate. Obviously the larger the forming tube, the more product that can be dispensed in a single auger revolution. For example, an auger that is 2   inches in diameter delivers 12.27 cubic inches of product per revolution, whereas an auger that s just a half inch larger in diameter delivers 24.74 cubic inches of product per revolution  twice as much. The size of the forming tube is of great interest to the filling machine vendor because the company wants to know how much space it has to work with inside that tube. Knowing this up front allows the supplier to determine if the specified speed can be met for the designed pouch size. If it does not, either the bag needs to be redesigned to a larger size or speed requirements must be reduced.

It is also important to review the flow characteristics for each product to be filled. In general, products are free flow or non-free flow, and each requires a different tooling setup. In some cases products can be a little of both, and the result is anything from an occasional drip to a steady stream of product flowing after the auger has completed its cycle. This may require a tooling set up that calls for a clam shell cut-off, a cone cut-off, or possibly the latest technology: vacuum cut-off. All three of these special tooling setups take up additional room in the form tube, causing the size of the auger and therefore, the output speed, to be reduced.

Dust removal is an area that also needs to be factored into the integration of the VFFS machine with the filling machine. Since the pouch is sealed on three sides, any dust from the fill will escape going up. If the application calls for dust collection, then dust collection is required to capture it, and it needs to be located within the forming tube   and that takes up valuable space.

Electrical specifications of each system are another area to consider. Often the end user will have an electrical specification that must be met. The filler supplier needs to know this upfront when quoting the project. There is also the possibility of the VFFS supplier and the filler supplier to share components. A good example of this would be to integrate control screens on a common HMI (human machine interface), thus giving the end user single-point control for the complete system. To do that effectively, it s best to approach this objective early on.

One final point on machine integration: Discuss the factory acceptance test up front during the quoting process. Will there be a test at the filler company, the bagger company or both? What are the criteria for these tests? Will the VFFS company require technical assistance from the filler supplier for the test? What are the criteria for the start, installation and training at the customer s plant? Technical assistance requirements should be defined and planned for in advance.

Bringing in all vendors together with the customer to discuss performance goals and share information early on in the design process will help streamline the integration between the FFS machine and filling machine. Vendors have expertise in their specific areas, and sharing information ensures all aspects of the integration will move along in a smooth and efficient manner.

 Parents with children often make a special effort to integrate as many healthy fish dishes as possible into their meal plans. AS P ltsamaa Felix (a part of the Orkla Foods Group) is working to support this target group in the Finnish and Estonian market with its two new yogurt sauces. This seems destined to succeed not just because of their great taste, but above all, the special packaging shape of the product. It was the ideal challenge for the experts at Greiner Packaging, which is able to offer customers the required skills as well as the logistics advantage nearby using its own location in Tabasalu, Estonia.

The plastic sauce bottles that were developed are in the shape of a fish and are designed to whet appetite for salmon, trout, and others at first sight.  The unique bottle shape gives the sauces that certain extra edge.

",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88994-us-demand-for-natural-polymers-to-exceed-5-billion,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400",,"U.S. demand for natural polymers to exceed $5 billionU.S. demand for natural polymers is forecast to expand at a 4.3% annual pace to $5.1 billion in 2020, reaching 1.9 billion pounds. Growth will be driven by demand for natural ingredients in the large food and beverage industry, which will bolster use of cellulose ethers and starch and fermentation polymers. Most product types will benefit from strong demand from the medical market, as natural polymers are used extensively in pharmaceuticals, wound care and orthopedic injections. These and other trends are presented in ""Natural Polymers,"" a new study from The Freedonia Group (freedonia.com).

Cellulose ethers are the largest product type of natural polymer, representing a third of the market. Methyl cellulose will retain its market-leading spot through the forecast period, but demand for hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) will also be significant. Methyl cellulose s largest application is construction, where it used in a variety of capacities, including plastering, flooring, grouting, mortaring, tile adhesion, and stucco.

Starch and fermentation products will advance the most rapidly of all natural polymers through 2020, with polylactic acid (PLA) accounting for much of the growth. As capacity increased over the past several years, PLA is one of the few natural polymers that has exhibited declining prices. This has been a boon for the packaging segment, which represents by far the leading outlet for PLA resins. According to analyst Larry Catsonis,  Hyaluronic acid will also support starch and fermentation products  gains, as it continues to be used to relieve joint pain in orthopedic injections and will also gain market share from collagen as both a dermal and topical tissue filler in cosmetic applications. 

The food and beverage industry will relinquish its spot as the largest outlet for natural polymers to the medical industry in the forecast period.

105,Kashi shows good looks and good food go together," 
	New visual identity on packaging features first-of-its-kind editorial-style storytelling. ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88992-kashi-shows-good-looks-and-good-food-go-together,"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 00:00:00 -0400",,"Kashi shows good looks and good food go togetherWith the inspiration that 'good clean food deserves good clean design,' Kashi  is launching a new and refreshed brand identity that reflects its belief that food should not only taste good, but do good. Created in partnership with Jones Knowles Ritchie, the new look is a commitment to visually telling the brand story of bringing people close to the food they love. Initial changes will be reflected across the company's logo and packaging portfolio.

As a healthy food pioneer for more than 30 years, Kashi has always been committed to creating foods that enable uplifting health. With an entire portfolio of Non-GMO Project Verified products and ever-increasing organic offerings, Kashi sought to develop packaging to better reflect its progressive food values, highlight the stories behind the foods and also revisit some of the inspiration from its original packaging. Kashi was one of the first brands to use white cereal boxes and, with this packaging refresh, is again shaking up the natural and organic category with a bold departure from imagery reliant on farm and field visuals. The new design features food front and center against a clean white canvas and accented with a design that is unmistakably contemporary   with clean lines, vivid colors and straightforward typography.

Kashi is also one of the first brands to incorporate editorial-style stories on all packaging about how the food was made and where it comes from   including employees, farmers and friends of Kashi who had a deep impact on it. For example, Kashi Dark Cocoa Karma Shredded Wheat Biscuits features the story of Wyoming-based farmer Newton Russell, who was one of first farmers to pilot the Certified Transitional protocol (an initiative to help farmers transition fields from conventional to organic) and grew the wheat featured in the first batch of this new cereal. Other packaging features Wild Willow Farm & Education Center, a 5-acre working farm in Kashi's hometown that focuses on educating the community about the progressive food movement and place where Kashi draws inspiration for its own foods.

""At Kashi, we are inspired by some of the world's most vibrant ingredients and love bringing them together to create tasty food that also delivers the best possible nutrition,"" says Jeff Johnson, surfing nutritionist and senior director of marketing and new ventures at Kashi. ""The new packaging reinforces our belief that foods should be clean and purposeful, the two ideas simply go together.""

""Kashi is changing the way it showcases its quality, starting with the consumer's first impression of the product on the shelves and the food itself,"" says Tosh Hall, creative director of Jones Knowles Ritchie, the branding agency behind the new packaging and identity. ""Our new design reflects values of the Kashi Company. The visual identity system and packaging tell the story of the product's quality, its origins and the dedicated people behind the Kashi brand.""

106,The role of packaging in food safety," 
	At every level of the supply chain, food safety procedures are closely scrutinized. Food packaging is one of the most important factors, as it covers materials handling, shipping and storage.&nbsp; ",http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88986-the-role-of-packaging-in-food-safety,"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 10:00:00 -0400",,"The role of packaging in food safetyAt every level of the supply chain, food safety procedures are closely scrutinized. Food packaging is one of the most important factors, as it covers materials handling, shipping and storage. A lot can go wrong if food products are not properly protected from the elements.

What are some of the key roles of proper packaging in food safety? Below, read about some of the risks associated with improper food packaging, as well as how the right level of care can make all the difference.

We live in a world in which food products grown on the West Coast can be shipped to the Midwest for processing and ultimately sent for consumption in the Deep South. The only reason that s possible is that we have incredible food packaging technology. Products can remain fresher for much longer under the right circumstances. By properly packaging goods, a consumer at the end of the supply chain can feel as if he or she is eating freshly obtained fruits, vegetables or processed goods.

Fresh appearance and texture are one thing, and contamination is another. Even locally grown and distributed food is at risk of contamination from bacteria during a short period of time. Food products that will be shipped or stored for a longer period of time are at even greater risk. That s why the right food packaging is crucial. Packaging that effectively locks out air and outside contaminants can mean the difference between happy, healthy customers and customers who fall ill. Contamination is a potentially deadly problem and can ruin your brand.

Even if your food is sealed and protected from contaminants, physical impacts and other forces can damage the product. That can be the case in food warehousing, shipping or simple materials handling. Sturdy packaging is crucial to protecting products from trauma   think boxes, crates or even strong plastic wrapping. Certain types of packaging can also include padding and other buffers to absorb the shock of transit.

Just as steps should be taken to prevent inadvertent human error, packaging should be utilized to prevent deliberate tampering. Food packaging should be especially secure when compared with any other type of packaging. Packaging should also include tamper

indication features. These include features that are not easily fixed when a package is breached   such as breakaway closures, printed features, special membranes or other types of graphics that change as a result of tampering. With the right food packaging, not only will you be alerted right away to tampering, but you can also deter others who might try to open your packaging.

While consumer safety is clearly your top concern, your brand image is something worth protecting. Even if the risk of contamination or tampering is minimal, going the extra mile with packaging can help demonstrate to consumers that you take their safety very seriously. Attention to detail is vital to protecting your company and your image. Food packaging is one of the first things a consumer will notice.

From start to finish, food packaging is one of the most important considerations for food processors or any other company that comes in contact with food products. The right approach can protect both you and the consumer.",FNB,FNB,"eating freshly obtained fruits,prevent inadvertent human error,include tamper

The high-speed roll-up door is compliant with guidelines established by clean Good Manufacturing Practices, the Food & Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture.

Made from a tough PVC vinyl curtain, the LiteSpeed Clean has a tapered design that uses non-exposed fasteners, making it more resistant to collecting dust than flat surfaces and easier to clean. It can maintain room-to-room pressure differentials of up to 0.2 InWC with its tight seal. Its roll-up design translates into a peak operating speed of 65  per second and a smaller physical footprint.

Using available safety presence sensors, personnel working near the door are likely to avoid a collision. However, if the LiteSpeed Clean is bumped or impacted, the TRUE Auto Re-feed  will automatically reconfigure the door back on its tracks. This eliminates a potential breach in a clean room environment and the downtime and costs associated with repairing a traditional door.

In addition to its ability to function well in clean environments, the LiteSpeed Clean also comes with an array of safety features. Most notably, the bottom of the high-speed door features Soft-Edge  Technology, which provides a higher degree of protection for product, personnel and equipment. An optional full-width vision panel allows workers to see what s on the other side of the door. A reversing slack sensor can reverse the door s course if an obstruction is sensed.

The system includes three FANUC  robots, conveyor and a completely customized 12-station indexing dial manufacturing system.

Simplimatic s engineering team designed the rotating dial to perform 12 individual functions to fabricate an intricate medical device product. The system is designed to preheat and form a medical-grade plastic barrier and join a preformed 2-part seal, labeling the barrier with variable size options, and punching a mounting hole into the product. After mechanical assembly, a FANUC LR Mate 200iD robot removes the completed item from the dial and places it on a conveyor for final verification and packaging.

 The dial we created was a completely custom piece of equipment,  Waheed Chaudhry, VP of engineering, says.  Our customer identified a need within their facility and we designed the machine to create a solution to that problem, all while increasing their production speed. 

 

 The system also incorporates vision, utilizing a SD Sony camera and an HD IP Basler camera positioned above a custom vacuum light table. Both cameras utilize FANUC  iRVision software which allows the cameras to locate the product, verify if the light table is clear, and ensure two barriers do not become stacked during production. The indexing dial, robots, conveyor, and vision systems work in tandem to satisfy exacting customer manufacturing requirements.

Simplimatic s design was created to replace the customer s manual processes and offers a wide range of production benefits. Using the autonomous system, the customer was able to double production throughput, increase consistent quality, and experience an expedient return on investment.

 It is very exciting to see these machines we ve worked so hard to program come to life within a customer s facility,  Klaus Wisskirchen, senior controls engineer, says.  The systems we create solve a complicated production line problem for our customers. It s very rewarding. 

After shipment and integration, Simplimatic provides every customer across the globe with 24/7 emergency phone support and optional on-site service to ensure customer satisfaction for the life of the product.

116,New Pasteurization Processes Give Food Companies Options,"Thermal pasteurization systems continue to improve, giving food and beverage processors an expanding universe of alternative treatments that align with changing market demands.",http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/pasteurization-processes/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 13:05:00 -0400",,"New Pasteurization Processes Give Food Companies OptionsAn unintended consequence of the Food Safety Modernization Act is a small explosion in the number of new pasteurization technologies available to food processors.

As processors undertake their due diligence in evaluating potential safety hazards in their production processes, many are finding that ingredients and raw materials previously considered no-risk actually are potential carriers of microbial or viral hazards. FSMA requires processors to take steps to remove those risks, and that can mean adding a pasteurization step.

In addition, some industrial manufacturers are demanding that their ingredient and raw-material suppliers pasteurize their finished goods prior to shipment. The aforementioned risk assessments have inspired a proactive approach to even low-moisture products that carry a slight probability of microbial contamination. Those ingredients and raw materials usually are subject to a kill step in the manufacturing process, but once inside the four walls of the plant, food pathogens can migrate undetected to any area, including packaging.

 Been there, done that,  is the knowing reaction from growers of almonds, a low-moisture food that was considered exempt from salmonella contamination until outbreaks in 2001 and 2004 proved otherwise. At the growers  request, USDA in 2007 began requiring that all almonds, whether raw, blanched or roasted, be treated to achieve a 4 log reduction in salmonella. Consequently, equipment manufacturers and technology providers validated their systems and submitted them for review to the Almond Board of California s Technical Expert Review Panel (TERP). The result is hundreds of validated pasteurization systems, including many alternative and leading-edge technologies.

Even when thermal or chemical treatment is the defense against pathogens, operating systems are subject to continuous improvement. When Deamco Corp. engineered a pasteurization system for Hilltop Ranch in Ballico, Calif., space constraints necessitated the use of a vertical pasteurization chamber and two Kason vibratory fluid bed cooling and drying units, which were selected because of their small footprints. The design resulted in a system half the size of a comparable pasteurizer. Real estate always is in short supply, though higher throughput, not space savings, remains the primary driver in pasteurization system design, notes Deamco s Armand Guilion.

Throughput may be manufacturers  priority, but consumers want minimal processing and nutrient retention, particularly with products associated with healthy eating. Nuts, seeds and sprouted grains are among the fastest growing food categories, and a number of TERP-approved processes retain the flavor, mouthfeel and nutrition of raw seeds and grains.

Among them is Log5, a system developed by Duyvis Wiener, a Dutch firm that originally engineered the system to treat cocoa and chocolate. The system mixes humid air with saturated (dry) steam to manipulate water activity and temperature level with moist heat and achieve a 5 log bacterial reduction without adversely impacting product quality. The first North American unit is expected to be commissioned in August at CHS Inc. s sunflower seed facility in Fargo, N.D.

The continuous process can pasteurize up to 20,000 lbs. an hour, depending on the product, according to Jochem Dekker, vice president at Log5 Corp., (www.log5.com) Phoenix, Md. Because temperatures are above the dew point, moisture pick-up doesn t occur, and the machine can both pasteurize and roast, says Dekker. The firm has U.S. orders for three more machines.

Saturated steam and vacuum are employed by Napasol North America LLC (www.napasol.com) to pasteurize at a relatively low temperature. The batch process was installed last year at Hazelnut Growers of Oregon s facility, pasteurizing 15,000 lbs. per hour. Systems capable of processing volumes as high as 30,000 lbs. per hour can be fabricated, according to David Barbera, business development director of the Fargo, N.D., unit of the Swiss firm.

Nuts, seeds and dried fruit can be pasteurized in either static or rotating autoclaves. Product is placed in bins before entering an autoclave, then transferred to a cooling plenum. The batch approach reduces the possibility of cross contamination, Barbera points out.

Electricity generates most of the thermal wallop in Revtech Process Systems  sterilization and pasteurization technology, with a blast of saturated steam finishing off any surviving microbes. A bigger distinction is the vibratory transport of the product with a technique described as impedance tube transfer by managing director Martin Mitzkat, cofounder of the Loriol-sur-Drome, France-based firm (www.revtech-process-systems.com).

Direct contact with a hot tube is the primary kill mechanism, and manipulation of counterweights to motors at either end of the circular tube creates the vibration. The earliest systems had two-inch diameter tubes; scale up to higher-throughput machines has produced 10-inch versions that can process 10,000 lbs. an hour. The next engineering challenge: a machine capable of 33,000 lbs. of throughput.",FNB,FNB,"pasteurization processes give food companies optionsthermal pasteurization systems continue,pasteurization processes give food companies optionsan unintended consequence,kason vibratory fluid bed cooling,raw materials previously considered no-risk,fastest growing food categories,food safety modernization act,managing director martin mitzkat,technical expert review panel,inactivate microbial life forms,system mixes humid air,napasol north america llc,evaluating potential safety hazards,adversely impacting product quality,revtech process systems  sterilization,terp-approved processes retain,validated pasteurization systems,vertical pasteurization chamber,business development director,manipulate water activity,produced 10-inch versions,finished goods prior,changing market demands,two-inch diameter tubes,aforementioned risk assessments,pasteurization system design,circular tube creates,impedance tube transfer,technology providers validated,space constraints necessitated,north american unit,fsma requires processors,sunflower seed facility,5 log bacterial reduction,primary kill mechanism,batch approach reduces,raw-material suppliers pasteurize,production processes,saturated steam finishing,pasteurization technology,pasteurization system,food processors,giving food,low-moisture food,pasteurization step,pasteurization technologies,raw materials,food pathogens,vibratory transport,cooling plenum,considered exempt,earliest systems,systems capable,operating systems,viral hazards,potential carriers,4 log reduction,batch process,hot tube,kill step,design resulted,primary driver,space savings,proactive approach,microbial contamination,system developed,system half,beverage processors,processors undertake,manufacturing process,continuous process,notes deamco,direct contact,barbera points,drying units,knowing reaction,due diligence,nutrient retention,small explosion,slight probability,real estate,healthy eating,migrate undetected,deamco corp,vice president,bigger distinction,processing volumes,duyvis wiener,temperature level,small footprints,moist heat,electricity generates,engineering challenge,surviving microbes,short supply,david barbera,moisture pick-,rf biocidics,dew point,chemical treatment,expanding universe,continuous improvement,2007 began requiring,saturated steam,minimal processing,manufacturers  priority,comparable pasteurizer,radio frequency,leading-edge technologies,dried fruit,low temperature,almond board,equipment manufacturers,cross contamination,treat cocoa,hilltop ranch,rotating autoclaves,armand guilion","Those ingredients and raw materials usually are subject to a kill step in the manufacturing process, but once inside the four walls of the plant, food pathogens can migrate undetected to any area, including packaging. per hour can be fabricated, according to David Barbera, business development director of the Fargo, N.D., unit of the Swiss firm."

118,Product Developers Taking a Cue from Breakfast-Snacking Trends,Product developers are taking a cue from breakfast-snacking trends to create new food products.,http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/breakfast-snacking-trends/,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 10:26:00 -0400",,"Product Developers Taking a Cue from Breakfast-Snacking TrendsDemand for a quick, tasty breakfast that's made with better ingredients is rising. As a result, consumers are seeing more new items in supermarket aisles, such as baking, muffin and pancake products with organic, free-from, non-GMO, natural and Fair Trade-certified ingredients.

Breakfast is popular at other times of day, too. What used to be exclusively morning foods are one of the top choices of food Americans eat when dining out. The Hartman Group finds that all-day breakfast offerings comprised 68 percent of all of the foods people ate at full-service restaurants, 63 percent at cafes, 60 percent in fast-casual and 55 percent in fast-food outlets, within a three-month time-frame.

McDonald's realized serving its breakfast items all day would pay off, despite saying for years it was impossible to make this move, that its restaurants were too busy to handle breakfast orders on top of burgers and the rest of the menu. But all-day breakfast fare has proved to be a crowd pleaser for McDonald s. ""This is the consumers' idea. This is what they want us to do,"" McDonald s president Michael Andres told the Wall Street Journal recently. ""This could be the catalyst for our turnaround.""

The traditional definitions of snacks and breakfast are also softening, as Packaged Facts notes consumers are changing their perceptions about breakfast, and the meal is evolving into an all-morning snack fest. 24 per cent of consumers snack in the morning instead of eating a full meal, the firm's new report indicates.

""As restaurant brands such as Denny s have long known, and as McDonald s success with all-day breakfast cements, foods traditionally associated with the breakfast daypart can also find success during other parts of the day and/or as a snack,"" says David Sprinkle, research director for Packaged Facts.

One of the largest independent processors of bacon and sausage in the country, SugarCreek Packing Co. (www.sugarcreek.com), Cincinnati, has noticed the impact of all-day breakfast on the industry. ""Clearly breakfast foods are growing, given the leading trends in quick-service restaurant segment. But I don't know if the breakfast day part is growing or just breakfast options sold at different times of the day,"" questions Lance Layman, vice president of business development at SugarCreek.

""Breakfast food options offered now throughout the day [may have] health benefits not normally available in hand-held lunch and dinner options,"" he continues. ""Based on market results, these are obviously benefits and options consumers desire. As breakfast foods grow, you'll see more focus on products that offer lower calorie options and deliver higher amounts of protein.""

All-day breakfast items will definitely be more popular at the supermarket as well, Layman adds. ""This is absolutely the case in retail segments, both behind the counter in foodservice offerings, as well as on the shelves. Foodservice trends almost always cascade down through the retail channel after first becoming mainstream within restaurants. As a baby boomer working to maintain a healthier lifestyle, I'm trying to eat smaller meals/snacks more frequently throughout the day, and this now includes breakfast. As a result, because I eat breakfast at home before work, I'm now eating a 250-calorie breakfast sandwich, ready in two minutes. Breakfast options both at home and away are offering me convenient and healthy options that meet my needs, at any time of the day.""

Breakfast and morning snack consumption in and away from home is forecast to grow by 5 percent through 2019, reports NPD Group, Chicago. Annual morning snack occasions per person in and away from home have increased 17 percent in the past six years, according to NPD's continual tracking of U.S. eating behaviors. The market intelligence firm cites speed, affordability and portability as main reasons. Convenience is why sales of breakfast sandwiches, better-for-you yogurt and cereal bars are climbing.

Although a lot of people are eating breakfast away from home, most breakfast meals, 70 percent, are consumed at home. The average annual number of breakfast occasions per person in 2015 was 361, NPD says, which is up 11 occasions per person from 2010.",FNB,FNB,"market intelligence firm cites speed,wall street journal recently,all-day breakfast offerings comprised 68 percent,president michael andres told,offer lower calorie options,breakfast food options offered,packaged facts notes consumers,annual morning snack occasions,average annual number,largest independent processors,hartman group finds,baby boomer working,deliver higher amounts,eat smaller meals/snacks,food americans eat,all-morning snack fest,all-day breakfast cements,all-day breakfast fare,questions lance layman,quick-service restaurant segment,morning snack consumption,exclusively morning foods,250-calorie breakfast sandwich,handle breakfast orders,product developers taking,breakfast-snacking trendsproduct developers,breakfast options sold,options consumers desire,fair trade-certified ingredients,reports npd group,foods people ate,all-day breakfast items,breakfast foods grow,breakfast day part,packaged facts,all-day breakfast,foodservice offerings,market results,breakfast options,eat breakfast,vice president,breakfast foods,healthy options,dinner options,consumers snack,breakfast occasions,food products,foods traditionally,restaurant brands,layman adds,breakfast items,breakfast sandwiches,tasty breakfast,breakfast meals,includes breakfast,breakfast daypart,breakfast-snacking trends,breakfast-snacking trendsdemand,retail segments,realized serving,healthier lifestyle,business development,three-month time-frame,main reasons,continual tracking,david sprinkle,retail channel,cereal bars,research director,foodservice trends,crowd pleaser,leading trends,fast-food outlets,hand-held lunch,traditional definitions,eating breakfast,increased 17 percent,pancake products,] health benefits,full meal,eating behaviors,supermarket aisles,find success,top choices,full-service restaurants,sugarcreek packing","McDonald's realized serving its breakfast items all day would pay off, despite saying for years it was impossible to make this move, that its restaurants were too busy to handle breakfast orders on top of burgers and the rest of the menu.

122,Baobab Is Taking the Food and Beverage Industry by Storm,"With more antioxidants than acai, this prehistoric, African-Arabian fruit is experiencing explosive growth within the U.S. food and beverage industry.",http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/baobab-ingredient/,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 16:34:00 -0400",,"Baobab Is Taking the Food and Beverage Industry by StormBaobab, a raw superfruit that boasts 50 percent more antioxidants than acai, is experiencing explosive growth within the U.S. food and beverage sector. Just in the past year, SPINS data shows baobab sales have increased 208 percent in all natural sales channels and 267 percent in supplements.

Known as the  queen of superfruits,  baobab boasts an unparalleled nutritional profile and is naturally bursting with fiber, essential minerals, electrolytes and antioxidants. The fruit has a light and subtly tangy flavor that blends perfectly with other fruit flavors, making for a nutrient-rich addition to a number of food and beverage products, and therefore quite attractive to companies operating in this space.

Not only is there a growing demand for baobab across the food and beverage industry, but the superfruit is also helping to provide opportunities for the rural communities of South Africa who harvest it.

The well-rounded nutritional profile of baobab lends itself to a wide range of uses and provides a number of opportunities for food innovation, depending on what the manufacturer wishes to highlight   for example, antioxidants, fiber or alkalization.

Baobab can be easily integrated into a range of food products including cereals and granolas, fruit and nut mixes, nutrition bars and powders, baking products, frozen desserts and more. Because of its high level of acid, baobab brings other flavors into focus   adding brightness and enhancing the finished product.

When it comes to the U.S. beverage industry, baobab has emerged as one of the most highly sought-after ingredients for a few reasons. For one, baobab is a gluten-free, highly alkalizing, low-glycemic food; all attributes that are trending in terms of beverage innovation. In addition, the cost of adding 50g of baobab fruit powder to a gallon of single-strength juice or tea is less than 75 cents per gallon. Yet, this addition delivers over 70,000 ORAC units of antioxidants, 25g of fiber (19g being soluble fiber), 1,135mg of potassium and 85mg of magnesium.

Not only is baobab an extremely cost-effective way to make beverages more nutrient-dense, but it s also a sustainable and incredibly versatile ingredient.

An equally important part of the growth story tied to baobab is the sustainability aspect, both socioeconomic and environmental. Some producers of baobab, such as Baobab Foods, work with rural communities in South Africa where baobab is harvested to help provide an income opportunity for those who hand-harvest the fruit, especially women. The cash they receive from their harvested fruit helps to feed their families and gain access to medical care and education for their children.

There s no doubt that the opportunities for baobab will continue to grow, especially given the rise of health-conscious consumers, which is leading to an increased demand for more nutrient-dense foods that also make a positive impact on people and the planet. We re already seeing baobab being utilized by leading brands in the food and beverage aisles, as well as private label brands and big box retailers, proving mainstream demand and acceptance.",FNB,FNB,"spins data shows baobab sales,food products including cereals,natural sales channels,incredibly versatile ingredient,growth story tied,well-rounded nutritional profile,subtly tangy flavor,big box retailers,equally important part,experiencing explosive growth,unparalleled nutritional profile,focus   adding brightness,private label brands,proving mainstream demand,harvested fruit helps,baobab fruit powder,baking products,beverage products,adding 50g,growing demand,increased demand,companies operating,naturally bursting,frozen desserts,rural communities,manufacturer wishes,medical care,highly sought-,beverage aisles,single-strength juice,nutrition bars,health-conscious consumers,beverage industry,easily integrated,000 orac units,high level,essential minerals,sustainability aspect,positive impact,extremely cost-effective,nut mixes,beverage innovation,finished product,beverage sector,blends perfectly,highly alkalizing,leading brands,income opportunity,south africa,gain access,past year,african-arabian fruit,nutrient-rich addition,boasts 50 percent,addition delivers,increased 208 percent,baobab foods,baobab brings,baobab boasts,baobab lends,wide range,make beverages,nutrient-dense foods,food innovation,raw superfruit,low-glycemic food,fruit flavors,soluble fiber","Baobab Is Taking the Food and Beverage Industry by StormWith more antioxidants than acai, this prehistoric, African-Arabian fruit is experiencing explosive growth within the U.S. food and beverage industry.Baobab Is Taking the Food and Beverage Industry by StormBaobab, a raw superfruit that boasts 50 percent more antioxidants than acai, is experiencing explosive growth within the U.S. food and beverage sector.

123,The Role of Sensory Properties in Food Development,"All of the senses influence what people choose to eat, so how do you stimulate them in new products?",http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/sensory-properties-in-food-development/,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 15:03:00 -0400",,"The Role of Sensory Properties in Food DevelopmentOur 10,000 or so taste buds play the most vital role in food selection. Beyond taste, sensory properties such as smell, sound, appearance and texture influence what we select to eat. Food must taste delicious, certainly, but mouthfeel, texture, looks and smell are also important to the overall eating experience.

""The aroma component of flavor is key,"" says Jean-Xavier Guinard at the University of California-Davis Extension, which is now accepting applications for its applied sensory and consumer science certificate program. Foods must smell fresh or ripe, and have what we recognize as the proper color, size, shape, consistency and opacity. Thumping a melon, for example, tells us a lot about its texture and ripeness, as does checking other foods for flakiness, moistness, dryness, oiliness and so on.

Sound is important, as consumers know foods must maintain a certain level of crunch, bubble, sizzle, pop, snap and crackle, without negatively affecting shelf life or nutritional profile. Food that's supposed to be crispy and crunchy should have the same crunch and crispness every time it's eaten.

Evoking a multi-sensory experience through food, condiment manufacturer Mizkan America Inc. (www.mizkan.com), Mt. Prospect, Ill., says a fusion of sensory responses is what creates a pleasurable experience. ""When quality ingredients are at the core of the food we eat, all of the senses are positively stimulated,"" notes Sara Delach, brand manager at Mizkan.

At Tasty Bite, a Stamford Conn., maker of Indian and Asian microwavable entrees, a trained, discriminating sensory panel considers five food attributes when developing something new: color/appearance, texture, taste, aroma and flavor. (Tasty Bite was a winner of our 2016 R&D Teams of the Year. Read more about the company)

""We work with a lot of ingredients across different cuisines, which helps us create specific attributes across variety of products, [so] defining the sensory parameters becomes absolutely critical,"" explains Shashish Hodlur, head of R&D. ""We focus on delivering robust and bold flavors while ensuring the desirable appearance, texture and consistency.""

Products must register high on the panel's ""wow meter"" in order to pass the test. Flavors should be robust and clean, and in synch with consumer expectations, Hodlur says. ""We have an index that measures ... 'wow levels,' and assess the factors that contribute to a wow.""

Every product must look appealing the moment it comes out of the package, he continues. ""Basmati rice has to look white, with long grains, and be free flowing. We expect a sauce to have a smooth consistency, and the vegetables should have a firm texture. The lentils in our lentil-based products must be firm but perfectly cooked. A cheese-based sauce should have a silky, smooth consistency without lumps.""

Food scientists at TIC Gums Inc. (www.ticgums.com), White Marsh, Md., use a combination of triangle tests and descriptive analyses. Triangle tests decide if there's a significant, perceptible difference between products when a change is made to one of them, explains Lauren Schleicher, food technologist. ""After a difference is identified, the next step involves a descriptive analysis to determine how the products compare across different sensory characteristics."" The food scientist then analyzes individual texture attributes, such as mouth coating, viscosity and astringency to hone in on which attribute causes it to be different than the others. TIC Gums has compiled a comprehensive set of sensory terms to standardize how product texture is described during the development process, she says.

Originally announced on May 31, the recall now includes more production dates after four new confirmed illnesses were linked to consuming raw flour contaminated with strains of E. coli. The illnesses reported to health officials continue to be connected with consumers reporting they ate or handled uncooked dough or ate uncooked batter made with raw flour. No illnesses have been connected with flour that has been properly baked, cooked or handled.

The additional products include 13.5-oz. Gold Medal Wondra, a 2-lb. Gold Medal All Purpose Flour, 4.25, 5- and 10-lb. Gold Medal All Purpose Flour, a 5-lb. Gold Medal Unbleached Flour, a 5-lb. Gold Medal Self Rising Flour and 2- and 5-lb. Signature Kitchens All Purpose Enriched Bleached and Unbleached All-Purpose Enriched Flours, respectively.

The company has proactively conducted flour tests and health officials are using whole genome sequencing to trace the illnesses, which led to the latest illness reports and recall expansion.

E.coli has been detected in a small number of General Mills flour samples and some have been linked to new patient illnesses that fell outside of the previously recalled dates. At this time, the company says, it's not known if there is a higher prevalence of E.coli in flour than normal, if this is an issue isolated to General Mills  flour, or if this is an issue across the flour industry. The newer detection and genome sequencing tools are also possibly making a connection to flour that may have always existed at these levels.

""As a leader in flour production for 150 years, General Mills is committed to convening experts to work with government officials to learn more and create new protocols, if needed,"" states General Mills president and COO Jeff Harmening. ""Most importantly, we want all the avid home bakers out there to have peace of mind and know the most important thing they can do to keep safe is to not eat uncooked flour.""

Cleaning processes are becoming more aggressive, requiring equipment manufacturers to provide a reliable solution in the harsh washdown conditions.

Providing a product to meet these demands requires proper sealing, smooth contours, and a design that eliminates nooks and crevices for potential food debris build up. These products also need to withstand a high temperature spray, at much higher water pressures and increased flow rates used in the cleaning process. Baldor Reliance stainless steel motors and Baldor Dodge Ultra Kleen gear reducers are rated IP69K for water and are proven to perform in demanding conditions.

Shareholders for the two chemical and ag companies have now approved their merger. After the deal is finalized, the century-old companies plan to break up into three parts within about two years. One company will focus on agriculture, one on material science and one will produce and sell specialty products.

Holding meetings took place where shareholders voted on the move, and the companies were reportedly pressured by investors to break up or find other ways to boost their businesses. They agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $62 billion.

In April, Dow's chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris pointed out that the chiefs of the three divisions of the merged company, which would be called DowDuPont, wouldn t automatically become CEOs of the three planned public entities.

Appointments they have settled on include Dow's chief financial officer Howard Ungerleider being named DowDuPont s finance chief. Dow's COO Jim Fitterling has been named operating chief of the merged company s materials business and James C. Collins Jr., who currently leads DuPont s agriculture business, will serve as operating chief of DowDupont's agriculture division. Marc Doyle was named COO of DowDuPont s specialty products business. Doyle presently leads DuPont s Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition & Health, Performance Materials and Safety and Protection businesses.

These assignments would go into effect once the deal closes, which is expected to be later this year. But as they prepare to combine, the two firms have been eliminating staff and closing facilities. In June, Dow Chemical said it would eliminate 2,500 jobs after spending $48 billion to take control of Dow Corning from Corning Inc., which makes silicone products, ending a 72-year-old joint venture.

The cuts should reduce the chemical giant s workforce by roughly 4 percent, and there are plans to close Dow's silicone factories in Greensboro, NC and Yamakita, Japan, as well as other administrative, corporate and manufacturing facilities. DuPont is laying off about 10 percent of its staff worldwide and also spun off its performance chemicals business into a separate company called Chemours last year. Dow also sold its AgroFresh specialty chemical business and most of its chlorine business.

Most recently, DuPont and Dow have concentrated on their agriculture businesses because of the growing demand globally for food supplies.

129,Boston Beer Co.'s Jim Koch Shares Frontline Manufacturing Lessons,Old-fashioned approaches to quality control and workforce management are among lessons learned by craft beer pioneer.,http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/jim-koch-manufacturing-lessons/,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 15:38:00 -0400",,"Boston Beer Co.'s Jim Koch Shares Frontline Manufacturing LessonsIt was the kind of discovery that gives food executives night sweats: Glass particles were found in bottles coming off the line at Boston Beer Co.

In his book,  Quench Your Own Thirst,  and a subsequent interview with Food Processing, Jim Koch recalled the day the Cincinnati brewery s head of operations called to report finding glass particles in filled bottles of Samuel Adams beer. Thousands more bottles were rechecked, with several more found with glass inclusions. Sampling of warehoused product at the company s Pennsylvania brewery revealed more contaminated containers.

Koch consulted with former FDA regulators, who advised him the risk to human health was almost zero and that putting a hold on warehoused product would suffice until a new bottle supply was found. Instead, he ordered a voluntary recall involving 990,000 cases at a cost of $25 million, an amount exceeding the previous year s profits.

When X-ray inspection first was promoted to the food industry, most of the interest came from baby-food makers, who feared the crippling consequences of ingested glass by the most vulnerable consumers. Today, beer and wine are the last bastions of glass containers. But Koch didn t react to the 2008 recall by placing orders for X-ray units.

 Even today, the optical recognition software isn t good enough,  he asserts, adding Boston Beer does use the technology,  but it s not enough. You need a human eye. 

In fact, the glass particles were discovered by a quality control worker using a sampling technique known as  candling the bottles.  It involves holding a bottle up to a light source to determine if it contains any contaminants. It s an old-school approach but, as the Cincinnati inspector demonstrated, effective.

One report of a minor injury occurred, and the recall resulted in only a temporary dip in sales. More importantly, according to Koch, is what the incident said about the company s commitment to product quality and integrity.

Joe Anderson created this document, ""My Vision for My Storeroom,"" while he was reliability manager at a J.M. Smucker plant in Ohio. In it, he communicates his vision and expectations, then asks vendors to sign it. Download your own copy today.

If Koch didn t start the craft beer revolution, he definitely fired the first shot. Beginning with $250,000 in start-up capital in 1984 ($575,700 in today s dollars), he decided it made more sense to retain the services of a top-notch brewmaster to oversee production at a contract brewery than to operate a second-rate facility that would have produced hit-or-miss batches.  There is the making of the beer,  he says,  and then there s a lot of dragging hoses around and being on a forklift that just didn t excite me. 

Even so, consolidation was leading to the closure of the regional breweries where Sam Adams was made. In 1997, Koch purchased Hudepohl-Schoenling, Cincinnati s 112-year-old brewery that had seen better days. Its 100 workers were Teamsters. Many acquirers would have laid them off and reopened with nonunion workers, but Koch rejected that approach.

 Most unions were good, I thought, and most employee problems were, in fact, caused by bad managers,  he wrote. Instead of layoffs, Koch invested in equipment upgrades and introduced worker safety programs with teeth. Morale skyrocketed, followed by productivity improvements that tripled barrels per person within six years.

 When we came in, we made it very clear that we put quality ahead of quantity,  he recalls.  We were using higher quality, more expensive ingredients, and we wanted people to be very proud of what we made.

 Some staff was afraid of the Teamsters, but I said,  No, no, I grew up with these people. They come to work every day to do the best job they can and be proud of what they do.' We gave them the tools to make the best beer in America. By getting them engaged, they not only made quality improvements but efficiency improvements.

130,Ingredients to Boost the Brains of Baby Boomers,"Omega-3s, tart cherries, phospholipids can keep cognition sharp in old age.",http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/brain-boosting-ingredients/,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 11:18:00 -0400",,"Ingredients to Boost the Brains of Baby BoomersIt s said that, for seniors, the difference between forgetfulness and Alzheimer s Disease can be reduced to a simple equation: If you don t remember where you put your keys, you are forgetful; if you don t remember what function keys serve, that s Alzheimer s.

This year, the first baby boomers started turning 70. And while  better-for-you  foods and beverages are filling shelves to help us avoid cancer and heart disease, or to provide energy to allow us to keep up with the millennials trying to take away our jobs, the need to focus on brain health and cognitive performance has become inescapable.

There s good news, however. Not only are many of the ingredients targeting our bodily woes good for our brains, too, research and ingredient technology have come together to make available a number of new or rediscovered ingredients from traditional Eastern medicine that help tired brains work better, longer.

Antioxidants and omega lipids probably are primary candidates for the all-purpose senior health category. While antioxidants, such as those that are richest in leafy greens and red, dark red and purple fruits and vegetables, are best known for protection against cancer and heart disease, their action in keeping the circulatory system clean means that the transport system working to bring oxygen to the brain is functioning at its peak. Omegas, well-established as critical to nerve and brain tissue development in fetuses and growing children, also work well for the aging brain.

The role of omegas in senior cognitive function was reaffirmed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study published just this February in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. For the study, the researchers treated 44 healthy older adults aged 50-75 years (overlaying the 1946-1964 timespan of Baby Boomers) with 2.2g of long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids for a period of 26 weeks.

They then assessed object-location memory to evaluate the impact of omega-3s on both learning and memory formation. Testing before and after omega-3 intervention, results showed omegas to  exert positive effects on memory functions in healthy older adults,  leading the researchers to confirm that supplemental omega-3s could help  maintain cognitive functions into old age. 

A leading cause of forgetfulness and faltering cognition is a result of chronic sleep deficit. Today s 50-65 year olds are also a part of what s called the  Bridge Generation.  They find themselves caring for kids at home as well as aging parents, all while holding down at least one full-time job. (This at a time when most working Americans are making less money than they did a decade ago.)

The National Sleep Foundation, among other researchers, reported that 40 percent of Americans are not getting enough sleep, and that  the amount of sleep the average person logs each night has been steadily decreasing over the past century.  Sleep deprivation and chronic stress deliver a one-two knock-out punch to cognitive health.

To address this, many beverage makers have been targeting both stress and sleep issues. Beverages made with the juice of tart cherries is one example. Tart cherries are high in melatonin, the so-called  sleep hormone.  It s known to help synchronize the circadian rhythms of sleep, shortening the time to sleep onset in some persons as well as improving the quality of sleep.

Hollywood, Fla.-based Dream Products' (www.drinkdreamwater.com) Dreamwater  shots  make use of melatonin and two other natural sleep and stress combatters, (GABA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). GABA is gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmission regulator that helps control brain activity. 5-HTP is a precursor of both melatonin and serotonin, the latter countering anxiety and depression.

The phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally derived compound well-noted for its role in memory and cognition. It is in particularly high concentration in brain and nerve tissue and fundamental for nerve cell and synaptic function, including nerve signal transmission and activity. PS has been recognized for decades as helping to mitigate mental, cognitive and behavioral decline secondary to neurodegenerative conditions, including age-related cognitive disorders and Alzheimer s.

Phosphatidic acid (PA), a key component of and precursor to PS, is found in nerve cell membranes and has a direct impact on nerve cell function, as well as acting as signaling compound. Combined into a single complex, PS and PA were shown in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of chronically high-stressed subjects to reduce stress and improve cognitive function at levels of 400mg each daily.

The roughly $108-billion merger, announced July 20 (Wednesday), is one of the largest corporate mergers to date, unblocking one of the last major obstacles standing in A-B InBev's way to create the world's largest beer company. A-B InBev will control about 30 percent of the worldwide market.

While antitrust enforcers have lately blocked several other major U.S. acquisitions, they took limited action against A-B InBev, though they are restricting the beer giant s ability to pursue the fastest-growing part of the U.S. beer market. They got AB InBev to accept an antitrust review of any future craft beer and distributor acquisitions. Usually, says the Journal, many of those transactions wouldn t be big enough to qualify for such scrutiny.

The Justice Department's agreement with AB InBev also limits the Belgian-based brewer from creating incentive programs to lure independent distributors into selling and promoting its beers over rivals. It means A-B InBev will have to drop a new plan that would financially reward U.S. distributors for focusing on brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois.

Now, A-B InBev faces China as its only regulatory hurdle, and market analysts expect to approve the deal, which requires shareholder approval, in the coming months. The move could prove more difficult than initially expected, now that the United Kingdom s vote to leave the European Union has sent the pound plunging. But A-B InBev is exploring related markets for sales growth. These include the hard soda category under its Best Damn Brewing line, low- and non-alcoholic beer, a Starbucks partnership to manufacture and distribute its ready to drink Teavana brand in the U.S., and certain Mexican beers that would compete in the U.S. with Constellation Brands.",FNB,FNB,"exploring related markets,hard soda category,largest corporate mergers,requires shareholder approval,roughly $108-billion merger,creating incentive programs,drink teavana brand,damn brewing line,rival sab miller,largest beer company,future craft beer,market analysts expect,wall street journal,lure independent distributors,major obstacles standing,inbev faces china,clears anheuser-busch inbev,sab millerthe world,sab millerthe,beer market,beer giant,non-alcoholic beer,worldwide market,anheuser-busch inbev,united kingdom,european union,sales growth,transactions wouldn,regulatory hurdle,limited action,antitrust review,stella artois,antitrust enforcers,justice department,financially reward,pound plunging,starbucks partnership,announced july 20,fastest-growing part,initially expected,justice dept,coming months,belgian-based brewer,ab inbev,mexican beers,takeover bid","While antitrust enforcers have lately blocked several other major U.S. acquisitions, they took limited action against A-B InBev, though they are restricting the beer giant s ability to pursue the fastest-growing part of the U.S. beer market.

The company also gained global value share in the non-alcohol ready-to-drink beverage market, it says.



 Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement:  Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, structural changes and foreign exchange headwinds which contributed to a 5 percent decline in reported revenues, we delivered 3 percent organic revenue growth, gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, expanded our operating margins and grew profits in line with our expectations. Strong performance in some of our largest and most developed markets, including the United States, Mexico and Japan, was offset by difficult external conditions in many of our emerging and developing markets, including China and Argentina. These factors combined to put pressure on our volume and top-line performance in the quarter, especially where we own bottling businesses. In these international operations where external headwinds have proven to be more severe than originally forecast, we are taking action by reassessing local market initiatives where needed and continuing our efforts in driving productivity.



  As we continue the transformation of our business, I am encouraged by our core business performance which grew ahead of our consolidated organic revenues in the quarter,  he continued.  We expect this to continue for the balance of the year as we remain confident in our segmented revenue growth strategy, our innovation pipeline, and efforts to increase and improve our advertising.

The unconventional hours were helpful while trying to also manage a growing company.

Among the activities I ve had the pleasure of attending was an art festival in the downtown area of my childhood community. Perusing the exhibits by local artists and enjoying the live music with my daughter and sister allowed for some great memories, but I also learned about a microbrewery right in my hometown.

One of the sponsors for the weekend event was Light the Lamp Brewery, a micro, craft brewery that was founded on the principles of great beer and a love for hockey   my favorite sport. Each brew is named after a hockey term/memory, like 1980 Miracle American Ale or Shorthanded IPA. Knowing the popularity of craft beer, it was great to see that my hometown has a craft brewer to call its own.

Community ties are ingrained in so many companies within the craft beer market. For example, Tim Kovac, who s craft brewery Small Town Brewing is this month s cover story (page 32), noted during our photo shoot how important the local community is to his brand. Although the craft brewer s brand Not Your Father s Root Beer (and its Ginger Ale and Vanilla Cream Ale varieties) have gone national, he still spends time in the company s taproom in Wauconda, Ill., talking to the local beer lovers as well as the patrons who have traveled great lengths to taste the gruit-inspired brews. Additionally, Carl Nolen, who s Wisconsin Brewing Co. is a contract packer for Not Your Father s Root Beer 10.7 percent alcohol by volume, touts how the Verona, Wis.-facility and taproom were completely built from Wisconsin-based suppliers.

And even though local communities drive the day-to-day success of taprooms and other tasting facilities, the out-of-towners are giving rise to destination drinking.

According to the World Food Travel Association, food and beverage are playing a growing role for leisure travelers with 75 percent stating they were motivated to visit a destination because of a culinary activity, the association stated in its  2016 Food Travel Monitor  report.

Surveying 2,527 adults who had taken an overnight trip or a trip that was at minimum 50 miles away from home in the past 12 months, the study found that 93 percent of respondents participated in a unique food or beverage activity while traveling in the past two years.

Beverage activities were popular for these culinary travelers with 46 percent stating they had participated in a beer, wine or spirits activity. Wine was the most popular with 31 percent naming wine activities and 24 percent naming beer activities.

What is more telling about these consumers is the value these respondents placed on food and beverage. Fifty-nine percent of survey-takers stated that food and beverage is more important during travel than it was five years ago.

Although the White Sox now play at U.S. Cellular Field and the concessions, including beverages, have gotten more sophisticated, baseball remains an all-American pastime. To capture the affinity of baseball connoisseurs, more beverage companies are showcasing their alcohol and non-alcohol brands both inside and outside of baseball stadiums across the United States.

During a recent game, I noticed concession stands and vending carts selling beer, wine, Margaritas and other cocktails. This is in sharp contrast to 25 years ago when beer, soda and coffee typically were the only available options.

Some beverage brands also have teamed up with the MLB to offer limited-edition products. For example, Cline Family Cellars released a new San Francisco Giants Pinot Gris that features the team s logo on its 750-ml bottle.

161,Technology advancements aid inspection equipment,"Packaging experts note that advancements in optical technology, software algorithms that are effective at high line speeds and the ability to inspect materials across the bottling process are essential for today s modern bottling facilities.",http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89468-technology-advancements-aid-inspection-equipment,"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 08:18:00 -0400",,"Technology advancements aid inspection equipmentCarrying a large magnifying glass, Inspector Jacques Clouseau, memorably played by comedian Peter Sellers in the famed  Pink Panther  series, was an inept French police detective searching for clues. Although Inspector Clouseau was not inspecting products in a beverage manufacturing plant, inspection equipment requires meticulous attention to detail to ensure safe production for all finished products.

Packaging experts note that advancements in optical technology, software algorithms that are effective at high line speeds and the ability to inspect materials across the bottling process are essential for today s modern bottling facilities.

Because more SKUs are being processed in lighter-weight bottles and with newer formats such as small-packet flexible pouches, which are quickly growing in demand, inspection equipment must be able to keep pace, they add.

 Higher line speeds, lighter-weight bottles/closures, the increased use of (post-consumer reground) [PCR] material and closely coupled blow-fill lines are four main trends that are impacting bottle inspection,  says Michael Coy, marketing manager at Pressco Technology Inc., Cleveland.  Any one of these individually is significant, and two or more in the same installation can put severe demands on even the most capable inspection systems. 

To keep up with these demands, Pressco Technology has designed a portfolio of solutions to aid beverage production lines.

 Our inspection systems provide detailed, real-time defect-correlation data that pinpoints problems with specific machine parts (such as blow molder spindles/molds/transfer arms as well as filler valves and capping heads),  Coy explains.  With distributed inspection you get the defective component out of the product stream before completing the next value-added operation. For example, rejecting a cap that costs less than a penny may prevent rejecting a filled-and-capped bottle that could cost ten-times as much. 

Although aluminum cans and plastic bottles continue to dominate the packaging industry, formats like pouches are resonating because of their convenience and portion-control capabilities, according to Oliver Wyrsch, general manager at Mettler Toledo CI-Vision, Aurora, Ill.

 Smaller package formats mean faster line speeds to meet the same volume of production,  he says.  Inspection equipment must both keep up and be able to account for greater product variation running on the same production line. 

Pembroke, Mass.-based FT System North America s General Manager Richard Reardon notes that advancements in the production process are impacting inspection equipment, adding that the production process often dictates inspection requirements.

 Processes like hot-fill nitro, high-pressure processing and aseptic filling are becoming more common,  he explains.  How containers are inspected, what they are inspected for and how the processes are tracked are all factors that impact the inspection equipment. 

FT System offers a broad range of inspection equipment for beverage lines, including laser absorption spectroscopy for leak and pressure inspection   one of the more advanced technological developments in beverage packaging inspection, according to Reardon.

 The technology sounds complicated, but basically these systems will detect vacuum in hot-filled applications or pressure in LN2 dosed or carbonated applications simply by passing the container through the laser beam,  he says.  There is no contact with the container, no wear-parts.   These cost-effective systems have a small footprint and will inspect 100 percent of the containers at full production speeds. 

With as many as four to five camera systems, FT System s sensor-based systems inspect caps and bottles before they reach the filler/capper as well as preforms on PET lines to ensure correct fill level, proper closure application, label inspection and full-case inspection. These procedures ensure all the containers are in the case without damage to the product, the company says.

To keep pace with faster, more efficient production lines, inspection equipment has gotten more sophisticated as well, featuring a wide variety of modalities, including sensors that examine for leaks, pressure, fill level, vision for code and cap inspection, experts note.

Yet, inspection scalability and flexibility remains paramount, particularly because eco-friendly packaging options, innovative bottle shapes and light-weighting have increased demands on the packaging industry and its inspection equipment, according to North Falmouth, Mass.-based Teledyne Tap-Tone.

The company offers twin-proximity inspection designed to address the adoption of EZ-O bi-metal cans. It also performs stand-up pouch inspection for seam and fitment closure defects, it says. The company notes that the proliferation of flexible pouches and detecting leakage was the catalyst for the company s October 2015 launch of its PRO Series Dual Sensor Compression   Twin Belt pouch inspection system, which inspects pouches for defects in the seals or fitment closures and rejects those that fail.

 The patented Twin Belt conveyor set is designed to compress the head space of the pouch, which allows a sensor to take a comparative measurement of both the infeed and discharge of the system,  Product Line Manager Michael Mierjeski explains.

New vision-inspection solutions also are being developed. For example, Mettler Toledo CI-Vision unveiled a new V2622 Flex-Lite Vision Solution for label and package inspection that enables manufacturers to inspect labels for barcodes, allergy information, expiration dates, and lot and batch numbers. Packaging integrity, including the presence and proper placement of labels, caps and other packaging elements, also is inspected, it adds.

 At the heart of the V2622 are smart cameras with unique resolution, lenses and lighting for different inspection,  Wyrsch explains.  Cameras utilizing liquid lenses automatically change focus within fractions of a second   [while] our CIV-Core software easily manages many vision-inspection needs. 

Mettler Toledo CI-Vision also offers a R50G X-ray inspection system that detects contaminants in products that are packaged in glass containers, which previously were a challenge because of the containers  thicker base. Because the thicker base absorbs more X-rays than thinner walls it masks foreign substances, it says.

However, the R50G system incorporates an angled X-ray beam that shoots through the base, maximizing detection sensitivity without sacrificing speed, it adds. The R50G system allows containers to run without gaps at high throughputs as fast as 1,200 containers a minute, it adds.

Pressco s Coy notes that effective software algorithms are an absolute must for today s high-volume production lines.  The software must go hand-in-hand with an interface that is very user-friendly, as it is becoming far more common for today s modern bottling facilities to operate with fewer skilled staff,  he says.

Safety and quality control also are key drivers of inspection equipment.  We are seeing an increase in the requirement to inspect containers and closures before filling and sealing to ensure quality and accountability,  FT System s Reardon says.  We have a fully automated, in-line quality control system (QCS120) that will inspect the container volume, closure torque and even CO2 content, [and] then return the bottle back onto the production line.

163,Craft beer drives premium secondary packaging,"Across the beverage market, the craft phenomenon seems to have made an impact. As the craft beer segment grows and more brands enter the market, craft brewers are utilizing secondary packaging as a means to stand out on the shelf and tell their stories, experts say.",http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89463-craft-beer-drives-premium-secondary-packaging,"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 08:16:00 -0400",,"Craft beer drives premium secondary packagingAcross the beverage market, the craft phenomenon seems to have made an impact. As the craft beer segment grows and more brands enter the market, craft brewers are utilizing secondary packaging as a means to stand out on the shelf and tell their stories, experts say.

The growth in craft beer has resulted in more engaging, premium and graphically appealing secondary packaging, they add. To achieve the high-quality printed graphics brands desire, secondary packaging suppliers continue to innovate and improve their offerings.

With the importance of aesthetics for retail craft packaging, Charles Pavia, director of marketing for Proactive Packaging, Ontario, Calif., notes that having high-quality printing and graphics is important and can be done economically, another crucial factor for the small craft brewer.

 One thing we re starting to see from inquiries is people are moving toward direct print because they understand that direct print is a very favorable economic model for craft brewers because they re not producing beer in the number of barrels as an [Anheuser-Busch InBev] or MillerCoors,  he says.    For a craft beer manufacturer to have a good-looking craft box is really significant because it ties into their overall perspective. 

Alex Green, vice president of consumer packaging for Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific Corrugated, also notes the importance of having quality printing on secondary packaging for craft brands. He says that the company s digital printing also offers a solution.  Georgia-Pacific was the first provider in North America to offer digitally printed corrugated at [a] scale that is ideally suited to help craft brewers maximize the potential of their packaging to tell their story,  he says.  As a result, craft brewers can now customize graphics on six-, 12- and 42-pack carriers.

 Georgia-Pacific Corrugated, in alliance with PAX Corrugated, developed a unique digital pre-printed corrugated packaging capability that provides craft brewers with a level of customization and flexibility previously unavailable,  he continues.  This introduction enables craft brewers to create packaging that attracts consumers at point-of-sale with high-quality graphics, low minimum-order quantities, variable images, all while saving on costly printing plates. 

The company recently launched an interactive website, customcolorbox.com, where craft brewers can design and order packaging. The packaging usually arrives seven to 10 days after printing, Green says.

Because of the propensity of craft manufacturers, especially craft brewers, to be transparent, tell the brand s story and offer unique, more premium products, premiumized secondary packaging is proliferating as it offers a way to reflect and enhance the brand s identity, experts say.

 Premiumization in packaging is a trend that cannot only elevate a brand, but also its perception amongst consumers,  explains Roxanne McSpadden, senior marketing innovation manager of beverage for Graphic Packaging International, Concord, N.H.  We have found in our research of marketplace trends that many consumers are seeking freshness, newness and variety, and they look at the visual impact when making a purchasing decision.

 In the case of the booming craft beer industry, the following many of these brewers have garnered online is impressive,  she continues.  That powerful storytelling and those preselling efforts really resonate with consumers and get them interested in trying. However, it s the packaging that closes the deal once they see it in the store. 

McSpadden notes that paperboard cartons can help build a premium appearance and offers opportunity for unique shapes and designs.  Printing and decoration enhancements, such as debossing/embossing, unique coatings for glass and matte appearance, metallic inks and substrates, holographic films and foil stamping are just some of the unique ways [a brand] can enhance [its] on-shelf presence and brand impact with secondary packaging,  she says.

She notes that the company offers several product lines of paperboard solutions.  Our latest innovation is ReShape, a new product line that provides beverage-makers with an ample flexibility to produce the pack formats they run today plus a wide range of other shapes and sizes, even multiples that weren t possible or common before,  she says.

Additionally, the company offers Tite Pak, an add-on system of features to glass packs that help reduce bottle breakage and eliminate inserts, as well as The Fridge Vendor, the can-dispensing 12-pack fridge box.

Secondary packaging offers increased branding opportunities for many categories within the beverage industry, and utilizing the most premium, quality packaging is essential to all of them, experts say.

 It is common knowledge that secondary packaging is no longer confined to protecting products and preventing waste during transit,  Georgia-Pacific s Green says.  Beverage brands and retailers are increasingly using innovative solutions to speed up the logistics of getting products onto shelves while also attracting consumers at point-of-sale. 

Rick Chlebos, senior director of sales for Chicago-based Coveris echoes similar sentiments.  Secondary packaging is the vehicle that conveys the brand and message at point-of-sale,  he says.  We are stewards of our customers  brands and take great care in making sure we are delivering on our customers  brand expectations every day. 

He notes that shrink solutions offer branding opportunities as well, and that Coveris  shrink secondary packaging offers the ability to cost-effectively shift messaging and modify promotional activity.

However, how a package will be used is an essential aspect to consider when it comes to developing the branding and graphics, Proactive Packaging s Pavia notes.  What we re starting to see is [that] you ve got to understand how the product is positioned and where it fits in [the customer s] portfolio, because some of the [companies] have  good,   better,   best,  lines,  he says. He explains that the design can change for packaging depending on where its distribution will take it.

  [W]e ve done some packaging for [brands] that are at retail, either in grocery or specialty stores, and then we ve run some packaging for beverage manufacturers that [was] really meant for on-premise bar sales, so the quality of [on-premise] packaging is dubbed down   it s not going to look like the packaging at Kroger, because it s behind the bar. 

Although a core job of secondary packaging has become branding, protection and convenience still are its central role, experts note. According to Coveris  Chlebos, a beverage-maker needs to consider that secondary packaging must get the product to the market free from damage, appropriately communicate the brand and offer easy transportation of the product.

Coveris, a shrink-wrapping solutions company, offers its Duralite film technology. Chlebos notes that advances in shrink-wrap technology have made it a more stable and durable option.  In 2016, we launched an updated version of Duralite, specific to printed applications, which enhances overall packaged enlongation haze and clarity,  he says.  These new films provide significant savings and improved packaging appearance and functionality for our customers, while affording consumers a more positive experience due to better package integrity and durability. 

Graphic Packaging s McSpadden also highlights the importance of convenience in secondary packaging.  Convenience translates to products that require easy grab-and-go packaging solutions as well as handles for carrying and dispensing features that make accessing the primary containers easy,  she says.

Georgia-Pacific s Green adds that several characteristics of the packaging must be considered.  There are numerous characteristics that secondary packaging should meet   but most importantly, safety, quality and efficiency,  he says.  It is also in the best interest of consumers and brand owners that packaging is made easy-to-identify and that information printed on the outside of the container communicates benefits that shoppers may be looking for in a beverage product.

The company made the announcement on the same day it said it was removing artificial preservatives from many of its products, and that it plans to stop serving buns made with high fructose corn syrup.

The shift to a more natural menu is part of a broad effort by the burger giant to improve its reputation among consumers who are increasingly concerned about the quality of their food.

 We re creating a different food culture here at McDonald s,  McDonald s USA president Mike Andres told a gathering of media at the company s soon-to-be-vacated headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill.  As a leader, we have an obligation to make big changes that impact the industry. 

Last year, McDonald s vowed to remove human antibiotics from its chicken supply by March 2017, a significant commitment for the chain, which has 14,000 locations in the U.S. and is a major seller of chicken.

Antibiotic-free chicken is already available at McDonald s, meaning the chain beat its goal by several months.

 It was something we knew we were going to be able to do,  said Marion Gross, McDonald s chief supply chain officer.  We use antibiotics minimally in our supply chain. 

Gross said the company focused on chicken first, because it has a  fully integrated supply chain,  meaning it manages nearly every aspect of its chicken supply chain,  from egg to chicken. 

 We have more controls around chicken,  Gross said.  When you have strong collaboration with suppliers, you can make big things happen. 

At the same time, McDonald s began working to remove some artificial preservatives, Gross said.

The company eliminated an artificial preservative from the cooking oil it uses to make its Chicken McNuggets. It also eliminated preservatives from eggs used for its biscuit and McGriddle sandwiches, as well as scrambled eggs.

McDonald s is also rolling out new buns this month for its Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, hamburgers, cheeseburgers and other sandwiches, which are made with sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.

The changes come as McDonald s works to improve its core menu and burnish its image. The chain has made changes to its salads, replacing iceberg lettuce with a mixture of romaine, baby spinach, baby kale and red leaf lettuce.

It added Buttermilk Crispy Chicken, started using real butter on its Egg McMuffins and committed to shifting to cage-free eggs by 2025. Since McDonald s made that commitment in September, more than 100 companies have followed suit.

McDonald s is focused on improving its core menu items as it works to continue to build sales.

 The core menu is essential to our strategy moving forward,  Andres said.  We want to make the core menu the best it could possibly be so people taste the core menu again. If you look at pricing and configuration, it s about helping people get to the core menu.

 You re going to see continued news around the core menu,  he added.

Smith held several leadership positions at the company, ultimately becoming vice president of operations at Bonefish in 2004, and then president at Outback in 2007.

Scarlett has been with Bloomin  Brands since 1994, having been a managing partner with an Outback in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.  No one is better suited to lead Outback in this era of growth,  Liz Smith said.

The RPI fell 0.3 percent in June, to 100.3, a result that still indicates industry expansion, according to the NRA. The industry is considered to be expanding when the index is above 100.

 The uneven trend that the RPI followed in the first half of 2016 was due in large part to choppy same-store sales and customer traffic results,  Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of research for the NRA, said in a statement.

More restaurant operators told the association in its monthly survey that same-store sales fell in June for the second straight month. The NRA found that 43 percent of surveyed operators said same-store sales fell in June, while 38 percent said same-store sales rose.

In addition, 49 percent of those surveyed said traffic fell, while 33 percent said traffic increased in the month.

As a result, the Current Situation Index was 99.9 in June, the first time in five months that the index dipped below 100, indicating industry contraction. The RPI is comprised of two different indicators, the Current Situation Index and the Expectations Index.

But expectations are waning, too. That index fell 0.4 percent, to 100.7 during the month. Operators  optimism about sales growth diminished, with 35 percent of those surveyed expecting higher sales in six months, and 18 percent expecting lower sales. That 18 percent was the highest monthly result for that question in four years.

Operators are also pessimistic about the overall economy. Just 16 percent of those surveyed expect economic conditions to improve in six months, while 25 percent expect conditions to worsen. That s the eighth straight month operators reported a negative outlook.

The Expectations Index fell to its lowest level in six months, which was likely driven by the choppy sales environment. But, Riehle said,  It s hard to draw definitive conclusions in either direction right at this point, because the indicators continue to send mixed signals. 

Still, the numbers provide more evidence that the industry is in decline following years of post-recessionary growth, brought on by some combination of overbuilding, lower grocery prices or mounting economic uncertainty.

Same-store sales have been weak all year, according to various sales indices, and that weakness spans most industry sectors.

But none of this appears to be stopping operators from expanding. Fifty-five percent of surveyed operators made a capital expenditure for equipment, expansion or remodeling over the past three months, the 21st straight month in which a majority of operators said they made such an expenditure.

And 57 percent expect that spending to continue over the next six moths, although that is down slightly from 62 percent the previous month.

The decline was unexpectedly large, and enough to cause the operator of Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar to lower its expectations for same-store sales and earnings for the full year. Investors didn t like the news, and Tampa, Fla.-based Bloomin  Brands  stock fell 7 percent in Friday morning trading.

But company executives insisted that same-store sales will improve in the second half of the year, and into next year as well. Their confidence is rooted in the company s decision to shift away from discounts that have dominated casual-dining marketing over the past decade, and to generate higher quality traffic.

 We have over-allocated our spending toward price-conscious messaging,  Bloomin  Brands CEO Liz Smith said on the company s earnings call Friday.  In 2016, we began to pivot. We will reduce the over-allocation of dollars toward traditional discounting and will allocate dollars toward the customer experience. 

Smith began the earnings call with a lengthy takedown of the casual-dining environment over the past decade. She said that the industry spent too much time discounting in a bid to win back customers.

Smith noted that deal-driven casual-dining traffic increased through the recession from 16 percent to 21 percent by 2010. Since then, that figure has only increased: She said 22 percent of today s casual-dining traffic is deal driven.

 This trend is unlikely to change, given the sluggish start to 2016,  Smith said.  Twenty-five percent of customers are truly motivated by price than by brand preference. 

And yet the heavy discounts haven t generated traffic overall. Casual-dining traffic has been falling for years, and has continued to do so this year. Segment traffic has increased only four months since May 2012, according to MillerPulse data, including a 2.5-percent decline in June.

 The industry overspent chasing a group through discounting and price promotions,  Smith added.  [Casual-dining] brands trade share among a subset of customers that are less brand loyal and less profitable, and unnecessarily subsidizing the majority of customers who would have visited, anyway. 

Bloomin  will work on improving the customer experience so it is  more focused on the numerator than on the denominator.  Although the company will be  sensitive to the macro environment,  it will  lessen our reliance on traditional discounts. 

Smith believes that doing so will help the company generate  high-quality, more predictable traffic growth. 

She said that the company has proven the strategy at Bonefish Grill. The company has spent recent quarters eschewing discounts in favor of a return to its polished-casual roots.

It was the only of the four brands to report a same-store sales increase in the second quarter, growing 0.9 percent.

Same-store sales fell 2.5 percent at Outback Steakhouse, 4.8 percent at Carrabba s and 0.8 percent at Fleming s.

The results were  softer than anticipated,  Smith said.

The company reduced its expectations for full-year same-store sales to flat instead of positive. It also lowered its earnings per share forecast to $1.35 from $1.40, and lowered its operating margin growth to flat. All of that was due to the sales decline.

Carrabba s  disappointed  in the second quarter despite a new menu and advertising.  The Italian category is increasingly competitive,  Smith said.  There are elevated levels of promotional activity.  She noted that 26 percent of traffic at Italian casual-dining concepts is  deal driven,  higher than the 22 percent for the casual-dining sector.

The company believes it has the strategies to improve same-store sales for the rest of the year, to finish 2016 flat instead of down.

The company recently began its DineRewards loyalty program that enables customers to collect reward points at all Bloomin  Brands concepts, making it the first multi-concept loyalty program in casual dining. The company started the program on July 19, and 800,000 people have already signed up.

Upgraded online ordering is generating more to-go sales. The average check for online orders is 15-percent higher than phone orders. The company is promoting bundled offers to generate more interest in online ordering.

In addition, the chain is testing delivery in 10 restaurants. Smith said that delivery could be  a sizable incremental sales layer  for casual-dining restaurants.

The company is also working on exterior remodels at Outback that have shown to generate sales.

By focusing on the customer experience, Smith said the company can generate more consistent sales over the long term.

 We know that historically every time we increase the 360-degree customer experience, we gain sales and volume,  Smith said.  We re reducing our reliance on straight price couponing. There are much more important and interesting things to talk about that bring customers in. Consumers are fatigued from coupons.

The Dallas-based churrascaria chain said the two new international joint-venture locations are among five the company has announced in its development pipeline, including new company-owned units in Georgia, Texas and Virginia.

 These new domestic locations and international joint-venture partnerships are perfectly aligned with our strategic vision and growth plans,  said Larry Johnson, Fogo de Ch o CEO, in a statement.

The operator has committed to growing company units by 10 percent a year over the next five years, and to developing in key international markets through joint ventures.

Fogo de Ch o said the Saudi Arabia location, its first in the Middle East, will be in Jeddah and developed in a joint-venture partnership with the Enany Group. The restaurant will be in Jeddah Square, near the North Corniche and high-end shopping.

The company s second Mexico City location, in the Santa Fe area, will follow the company s launch last year in the Polanco district. Developed with joint-venture partner The Lacador Group, the second unit will be near a large retail mall and high-end hotels, Fogo de Ch o said.

Fogo de Ch o opened new domestic restaurants earlier this year in Naperville, Ill., in January and King of Prussia, Pa., in July. The next three locations include Dallas  Uptown neighborhood; Dunwoody, Ga., in suburban Atlanta; and Tysons, Va., the second location in the Washington, D.C., area. Future locations will be in Bellevue, Wash.; Plano, Texas; and Pittsburgh.

Fogo de Ch o, founded in Brazil, opened its first U.S. restaurant in Dallas in 1997 and went public in 2015. It operates 42 company-owned locations in the United States and 10 restaurants in Brazil.

(Different location pictured)

New Jersey-based fast-casual chain Bubbakoo s Burritos opened its first franchise location today, in the Silverton section of Toms River, N.J., about eight miles down the Jersey Shore from the chain s original Point Pleasant, N.J., location.

Beach-themed Bubbakoo's was founded in 2008 by Johnny Rockets operations veterans Paul Altero and Bill Hart. It offers the usual fast-casual burrito fare such as burritos, bowls, tacos, salad, nachos and quesadillas, but with 16 different protein options   including fried chicken, barbecue pork, Buffalo shrimp and grilled steak. Vegetarian options include a bean-cheese-guacamole combo and batter-fried jalape os.

Bubbakoo s also features Altero and Hart s own invention: cheese-smothered, panko-crusted fried rice balls called The Chiwawa. Nods to local food customs include an optional topping of peppers and onions   Philly cheesesteak-style   and the Jersey Shore delicacy of batter-fried Oreo cookies.

Average unit volumes are around $800,000. The average check is around $11.

The franchisees are the Di Pierro family, who operate two other restaurants in Toms River, Joey D s Brick Oven Pizzeria & Restaurant and Mangia Brick Oven Pizza.

 It s a grand slam, line out the door. The franchise they gave us is incredible,  said Daniel Di Pierro, one of the partners, on opening day.

The Di Pierros met Altero and Hart after the franchisors opened a Bubbakoo s restaurant next to Joey D s.

 We saw them grow as we grew,  Di Pierro said, noting that Bubbakoo's seemed to have a particular appeal to young people.

The franchisors previously told Nation s Restaurant News that community involvement, particularly with local churches and schools, is a key to the chain s success and helps drive initial trial of the restaurant.

 The time came when they started franchising and we decided to take a shot with them,  Di Pierro said, adding that he and his family hope to open an additional two to three locations.  As long as everything goes the way this is going [now], we ll be opening more,  he said.

 These guys are great to work with. They re behind us 120 percent,  Di Pierro added, noting that four members of the corporate team plan to stay at the new restaurant for a week to help manage the opening.  So that s unbelievable. We ve never seen that in a franchise before. 

Hart said he was looking for more franchisees like the Di Pierros.

 The Di Pierros are exactly the right entrepreneurs to start our franchise family,  he said in a press release announcing the opening.  The family s vast knowledge of and experience in the restaurant industry, as well as its strong local roots, are outstanding. We are eager to see them fill the demand for a delicious and innovative Mexican-American fast-casual eatery in Silverton. 

The franchisors said they planned to continue to open company and franchised locations along the Jersey Shore and elsewhere in the state.

Correction: July 29, 2016  An earlier version of this article misstated Bubbakoo s average unit volume, which is $800,000.

  read more  ",http://nrn.com/dessert-trends/drinkable-desserts-are-growing-menus,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 15:00:00 +0000",Dessert Trends,"Drinkable desserts are growing on menusAt restaurants across the country, diners are having their dessert and drinking it, too. That s because a growing number of chefs   some questioning the need to use utensils for a meal's final course   are increasingly adding innovative, drinkable desserts to their menus.

 Personally, I'd drink dessert over eating one, especially if it has alcohol,  said Dee Ann Quinones, head bartender at Westbound in Los Angeles.  Westbound s spiked shakes are like not needing to pick between a dessert or cocktail   you re getting the best of both! 

Inspired by the proximity of their neighbors, Van Leeuwen Artisanal Ice Cream, and the SoCal heat wave, the team at Westbound, a new train- and travel-themed bar in Los Angeles  Arts District, partnered to develop creative alcoholic shakes. Among the offerings available in August are the London Fog, an English-style shake made with Earl Grey ice cream paired with Westbound s housemade lemon sorbet and Beefeater gin, garnished with lemon curls; and the Grasshipster, a play on the 1970s favorite Grasshopper cocktail, made with the Mint Chip ice cream, Fernet Branca, cr me de cacao and cr me de menthe, garnished with mint.

At P blico, a South American and Mexican restaurant in St. Louis, chef de cuisine Brad Bardon collaborated with head bartender Nick Digiovanni to create the Boozy Rhubarb Paletta. It s a multiple-treats-in-one dessert made by pouring strawberry-limecello over brown butter ice cream and then dropping in a rhubarb popsicle.

 It s not only visually appealing, it allows guests to customize their experience,  said Digiovanni.  They can let it melt or enjoy the popsicle as more of a frozen treat. I think there s a sense of nostalgia tied to cold, drinkable desserts. 

Indeed, many of the drinkable desserts on menus are fresh, often boozy, takes on classics, such as floats or milkshakes, which have been popular on menus for a few years now.

For example, on the menu at David Burke fabrick in New York City is the Grown-Up Float, a take on the classic root beer float. The sippable treat features Hudson four-grain bourbon ice cream that has hints of praline and vanilla. It's topped with a choice of regular or hard Coney Island Root Beer and served with a side of homemade chocolate chip sea salt cookies.

 I love grown-up takes on childhood favorites. There's something nostalgic and naughty about it,  said chef Zac Young, owner and pastry director at Craveable Hospitality Group, fabrick s parent company.  Plus, at the end of a large meal, who really wants to chew? Call me lazy; I want to drink my dessert and then take a nap! 

Similarly, the culinary team at Del Campo in Washington, D.C., has a  Bite My Cocktail  menu, a selection of cocktails with edible components. Among the current offerings is the Postre, made with Jeremiah Whiskey, house-infused Oreo cream vodka, root beer ice, smoked cream and toasted marshmallows.

Other restaurants are offering up lighter versions of the float, such as WP24 by Wolfgang Puck, which is serving Champagne Floats, made with champagne paired with a choice of passion fruit, strawberry, or peach sorbet, at the rooftop patio of the Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles. At Intro Chicago, executive chef Stephen Gillanders, inspired by a recent trip to South Korea, is serving a Blackberry Sorbet Float, made with fresh lychee and makkoli   a sparkling sake.

Hot chocolate, perhaps one of the most classic drinkable desserts, has gotten a makeover from several restaurants as well.

Last winter, the St. Regis Aspen Resort in Aspen, Colo., launched Hot Cocoa on a Stick, a two-person dessert that comes with six different chocolates on a stick that diners then dip into steaming cups of milk and stir, allowing the chocolate to melt for a drinkable indulgence. The popular, off-menu dessert is expected to return this winter.

At Cape Dutch, a South African-inspired steakhouse in Atlanta, executive chef Philippe Haddad is offering the Callebaut Belgian Chocolate Soup, a bowl of warm chocolate served with brittle raisin-walnut bread, hazelnuts and crispy rice. Available year-round, the soup is the restaurant s best-selling dessert.

 The whole juicing movement has accustomed people to drinking their food, so why not extend that to desserts?  Haddad said.  It may not be as healthy as juicing, but it sure satisfies the soul!""",FNB,FNB,"sippable treat features hudson four-grain bourbon ice cream,homemade chocolate chip sea salt cookies,chef de cuisine brad bardon collaborated,van leeuwen artisanal ice cream,hard coney island root beer,earl grey ice cream paired,brown butter ice cream,mint chip ice cream,house-infused oreo cream vodka,executive chef stephen gillanders,develop creative alcoholic shakes,executive chef philippe haddad,1970s favorite grasshopper cocktail,classic root beer float,callebaut belgian chocolate soup,los angeles  arts district,root beer ice,head bartender nick digiovanni,chef zac young,socal heat wave,craveable hospitality group,dee ann quinones,increasingly adding innovative,brittle raisin-walnut bread,launched hot cocoa,south african-inspired steakhouse,warm chocolate served,housemade lemon sorbet,david burke fabrick,regis aspen resort,blackberry sorbet float,classic drinkable desserts,english-style shake made,boozy rhubarb paletta,frozen treat,smoked cream,serving champagne floats,head bartender,champagne paired,hot chocolate,de menthe,de cacao,los angeles,spiked shakes,peach sorbet,lemon curls,south korea,south american,drinkable indulgence,drinkable desserts,pastry director,passion fruit,wolfgang puck,accustomed people,recent trip,visually appealing,fernet branca,travel-themed bar,sparkling sake,steaming cups,beefeater gin,intro chicago,jeremiah whiskey,edible components,parent company,london fog,toasted marshmallows,rhubarb popsicle,nostalgia tied,lighter versions,rooftop patio,childhood favorites,del campo,pouring strawberry-limecello,cape dutch,crispy rice,york city,cocktail  menu,off-menu dessert,current offerings,mexican restaurant,two-person dessert,best-selling dessert","Inspired by the proximity of their neighbors, Van Leeuwen Artisanal Ice Cream, and the SoCal heat wave, the team at Westbound, a new train- and travel-themed bar in Los Angeles  Arts District, partnered to develop creative alcoholic shakes.

For the June 28-ended quarter, the Calabasas Hills, Calif.-based company reported net income of $38.6 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with $34.7 million, or 69 cents per share, a year ago.

Same-store sales for the casual-dining chain increased a modest 0.3 percent for the core Cheesecake Factory brand, including a roughly 2.9-percent increase in menu pricing and a 0.2-percent benefit from menu mix. Traffic declined 2.7 percent for the quarter, which executives blamed in part on regional economic challenges in Texas and Florida.

But David Overton, The Cheesecake Factory chairman and CEO, said the chain outperformed the casual-dining industry and delivered its 26th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales.

 Capturing operational efficiencies, coupled with a benign commodity cost environment, enabled us to offset industry wage inflation and drive strong margins and earnings growth during the quarter,  Overton said in a statement.

The company rolled out its mobile payment app CakePay nationwide during the quarter. MasterCard is expected to feature the app in an upcoming TV ad campaign for the Masterpass digital wallet solution, Overton said.

The chain also opened the first Cheesecake Factory in China, a flagship location at the Disneytown area of Shanghai Disney Resort, under a licensing agreement.

Overton said the chain has expanded its test of delivery with a third-party provider to most restaurants across California.

In fiscal 2016, The Cheesecake Factory plans to open as many as eight company-owned restaurants domestically, and four to five under licensing agreements internationally.

The Cheesecake Factory Inc. ended the quarter with 202 restaurants, including 180 of the namesake brand, 12 Grand Lux Cafes and one RockSugar Pan Asian Kitchen.

Lebanon, Tenn.-based Cracker Barrel opened the first Holler & Dash in March, in Homewood, Ala., and the second on July 12, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

Planned openings announced Thursday include will be in October, in Celebration, Fla., and in November, in Brentwood, Tenn., a southern suburb of Nashville, Tenn.

The next locations will be a bit larger than the existing units. The recently opened Tuscaloosa restaurant is 1,991 square feet, but the Celebration unit will be about 2,800 square feet, and Brentwood will be about 3,800 square feet, Mike Chissler, chief operating officer for Holler & Dash, said in an interview. Seating ranges from 44 inside and 28 on a patio in Tuscaloosa, to 100 seats inside and out at the Tennessee location.

 In each location, we want it to feel very authentic and fit into the local neighborhood,  Chissler said.  We re trying a couple of different things with size to see what works best for us as we move forward. 

The base menu with 11 biscuit sandwiches will remain much the same as in the original location. Take-out ranges from 18 percent to 19 percent of sales, Chissler said.

Chef Brandon Frohne, Holler & Dash director of culinary development, said side items and beverages will be localized.

 The whole idea is to respect the regions we are in from a Southern food culture perspective,  Frohne said.  We wanted to design something that gives a nod to the region. 

For the anticipated October Florida entry, Frohne said, he s creating side items that pay homage to the region s farm industries, with pickled heirloom tomatoes and housemade craft sodas with citrus flavors like a tangerine cr me soda.

 In our restaurants right now, all of our grits and oats are locally sourced,  he said.  I m on the hunt for those in our Florida market right now. 

The bestseller on the concept s menu in its first five months is the Kick Back Chicken.

 It s an antibiotic-free Springer Mountain [Farms] chicken breast topped with local goat cheese out of Birmingham [Ala.] and a really, really good sweet-and-spicy pepper jelly out of Nashville,  Frohne said.  We just want to make additions to the menu for each region. 

Frohne said he plans to introduce techniques like fermentation at the Holler & Dash in the Nashville market.

 That s one of my favorites,  he said.  You ll see nods on our menu. We re developing right now a fermented collard-green kimchi, and also a fermented honey mustard. The flavor is unbelievable. We want to bring a modern Southern flair to everything we do. 

Chissler said hours for the Holler & Dash concept will be flexible depending on the locations. Generally, the restaurants are open from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., but the Tuscaloosa location s hours were expanded to appeal to a college crowd.

 When we get to Florida and Brentwood, it will depend upon what s surrounding us,  Chissler said, referring to office space nearby in Florida.

 What we like about 7-to-2 is that we can use the space after we close for events and catering,  Chissler added.  We ll explore those items as we move forward. 

Chissler said the biggest challenge for the fledgling brand is maintaining an appealing culture.

 We re known for this great Southern hospitality. I think we have a great plan,  he said.  If we can deliver as well in the next two restaurants. The team has responded well.

 As Tropical Smoothie Cafe continued growing and evolving over the past several years, it became obvious to us that our brand s image needed to follow suit. We launched this rebranding in an effort to ensure every location nationwide reflects our company s vibrant and engaging personality while communicating the right message to consumers, and we re thrilled that our new restaurant design has accomplished that goal,  said Mike Rotondo, chief executive officer of Tropical Smoothie Cafe.

The new restaurant will open on Tuesday, Aug. 9 and is located at 1760 Dunlawton Ave in the Dunlawton Commons. This location is owned and operated by existing husband-and-wife franchisee team Buck and Brooklyn Harris, who also own the Chicken Salad Chick restaurant in Ormond Beach and plan on opening a third location in Florida in the near future. Their Port Orange restaurant marks the 13th Chicken Salad Chick location in Florida.

During grand opening week, guests will enjoy southern hospitality through giveaways and specials at the new Chicken Salad Chick restaurant:

All guests who make a purchase within the first week of business can also enter themselves into a drawing to win a free Louis Vuitton bag, valued at $950. The drawing will take place on August 13, and the winner will be notified the same day. **

 With more than 15 years of experience in foodservice, I truly believe that Chicken Salad Chick s culture and menu offerings are unmatched in the fast casual industry,  said Buck Harris, Port Orange Chicken Salad Chick franchisee.  Once my wife and I saw the success of our Ormond Beach location, we knew it was time to open a second restaurant. I m confident the local community in Port Orange will fall in love with the brand s chicken salad and enjoy the genuine hospitality that is offered at all Chicken Salad Chick restaurants. 

The husband-and-wife duo opened their first Chicken Salad Chick restaurant in Ormond Beach in October 2015. Prior to Chicken Salad Chick, Buck owned and operated a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Ormond Beach for 15 years. He ultimately made the switch and became a Chicken Salad Chick franchisee after experiencing the brand s culture and product offerings firsthand. Buck and his wife have agreed to develop multiple Chicken Salad Chick restaurants in Central Florida over the next several years.

The Chicken Salad Chick concept, born in Auburn, Ala., was established in 2008 in the kitchen of founder, Stacy Brown. When Stacy discovered that the local county health department would not allow her to continue making and selling her delicious recipes out of her home kitchen, she overcame that obstacle by launching her first restaurant with the business expertise of her future husband and fellow founder, Kevin Brown. Together, they opened a small takeout restaurant, which quickly grew; the company now has 58 restaurants across the Southeast.

Chicken Salad Chick in Port Orange will be open Monday   Saturday from 10:30 a.m.   8 p.m. For more information, visit http://www.chickensaladchick.com, or call 386-265-5250. Follow Chicken Salad Chick on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest news and trends.

Epson America, Inc., a leading supplier of value-added Point of Sale (POS) solutions, and Fishbowl, an intelligent marketing automation and analytics platform provider for the restaurant industry, today announced their partnership at RSPA RetailNOW, allowing Fishbowl to source data from Epson s new OmniLink Merchant Services (OMS) platform. The joint solution, which facilitates access to customer data and enables restaurants to gain actionable insights, will be demonstrated at RSPA RetailNOW, July 31- August 3 at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center, in Grapevine, TX, Epson booth 801.

According to Hospitality Technology s 2016 Restaurant Technology study,  40% of restaurants are looking at cloud-based software, landing this technology at the top of the R&D list.  The study adds that customer engagement solutions also dominate the list and stresses the importance of data analytics.   Industries that are on the frontline of customer interactions have to realize that customer insights are their single biggest weapon in the relevancy war.  The study also sites poor system integration as a top challenge.  Epson s OMS partner network is designed to help restaurants and solution providers easily access and leverage customer data via the cloud.

The addition of Fishbowl to Epson s OMS suite of cloud and mobile applications gives users the ability to unravel complex business insights and take action on those insights, leading to improved customer engagement.  Epson s OMS platform offers an integrated solution that will work across tablets, mobile devices, multiple locations, and with any POS system that might be sitting on their counters.

 Our partnership with Fishbowl gives brands and marketing stakeholders the ability to leverage advanced analytics and drive personalized promotions in real time, sourced from the Epson OmniLink receipt printer data, independent of their POS system,  said Joel Doherty, global business development leader for Epson s Business Systems Division.   By collaborating with Fishbowl, we are offering a strong marketing analytics and automation solution for the restaurant industry in one easy-to-use, integrated platform that will significantly enhance business efficiencies and drive increased sales. 

 The lack of a simple, easy-to-use, access point for all restaurant data has been an industry challenge,  said Dev Ganesan, CEO of Fishbowl.  Epson s OMS cloud platform enables efficient, consolidated multi-data source access that can be used for advanced analytics and greater marketing efficacy   a mission critical mandate in this highly competitive vertical industry.  By leveraging rich insights from the data, restaurant operators can acquire new customers and retain existing ones through more relevant content and engagement   driving greater sales and traffic   via Fishbowl s multi-channel marketing platform.  We are excited about the possibilities that the Epson and Fishbowl partnership offers. 

Epson s OMS platform addresses the fundamental market challenge of disparate POS solutions and the lack of a common data language in the industry.  Epson s intelligent receipt printers provide a secure data gateway which drives cloud and mobile solutions to manage inventory, staffing, loss/prevention, merchandising, logistics, analytics, loyalty, online ordering and more without having to worry about costly POS integration. To date, 10 Epson partners have adopted the OMS platform, which opens up the options and choices for brands and restaurant operators to access a global network of cloud and mobile-based tools, best practices, business data and expertise. Partners include DTT Surveillance, Expensify, Fishbowl, GuestDNA, Livelenz, Mobivity, NimbleSchedule, PnP Loyalty, 7Shifts, and Spendgo.

The Mango Mariachi cocktail was named by an online fan, and chosen as the winning selection for premium tequila libation with fresh, juicy flavor. Fans from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were all invited to submit names as part of a week-long contest, with the winner announced on July 28th.

You could see people really having fun with this contest, and getting excited to try the new drink at their local OTB restaurant. We think guests will enjoy ordering The Mango Mariachi as much as they enjoyed naming it. 

The winning name submission by Ray Osborne, of Denver, CO, was chosen from hundreds of entries for its clever creativity that reflects both the lively spirit of the On the Border brand and the zesty unique taste of the cocktail itself. Made with Herradura Silver Tequila, the top-shelf cocktail is a vibrant blend of mango syrup, sweet and sour mix, orange juice, and Sprite plus an orange slice garnish.

When Wan Kim opened the first Smoothie King franchise in Seoul, South Korea in 2003, he had his work cut out for him. At that time, most South Koreans had never even heard the word  smoothie  before. This meant that Kim had to grow a brand and a concept in a country that was not familiar with either.

But Kim was committed to Smoothie King. He had purchased the rights to build 50 stores in South Korea over the next five years. He quickly realized that if he was going to succeed, he would have to single-handedly create the smoothie market in South Korea from scratch.

 It wasn t easy at first people in South Korea saw that we were the  King  of smoothies, but they still didn t understand what a smoothie was. So I dedicated myself to educating people. I truly believe that people are always striving to be their best   to always be healthier. I knew that when people realized Smoothie King s mission to inspire a healthy and active lifestyle, they d eagerly embrace it. So as often as I could, I shared that story with others,  Kim said.

Kim s dedication paid off in a big way. By 2007, his revenues grew exponentially and today, South Korea has more than 90 Smoothie King locations. Fueled by the impact that Smoothie King had on South Korea, Kim s passion for the brand grew. So much so, that by July 2012, he decided to buy the company from its New Orleans-based founder, Steve Kuhnau. Kim brought a vision to create 1,000 franchised and corporate Smoothie King locations globally by 2017. Now, with 780 locations worldwide, it s clear that Kim can deliver on his vision. After all, he eats, sleeps and breathes everything that Smoothie King represents and that s the opportunity to change people s lives.

From the very beginning, Kim has always worn his passion for the brand on his sleeve. He has a genuine desire to help others, and by spreading Smoothie King s mission throughout the world, he truly believes he is doing just that. That s why his vision for Smoothie King is simple: to build an extraordinary purpose-driven brand that s an integral part of every health and fitness plan.

 Think about the other concepts out there that you see on every street corner. They re selling pizza, tacos and burgers. I would never ask my own children to eat these products every day. But then, I felt very comfortable with the idea of them having Smoothie King s products regularly,  Kim said.  That s very important to me, and it s why I believe so strongly in this brand you shouldn t be shameful of the products you re selling. You should be proud. Smoothie King was born to help people live a healthy lifestyle, and that s something I really am proud to share with the rest of the world. 

As nutrition increasingly becomes an integral part in consumers  lives, Kim has made it his goal to better marry taste and nourishing ingredients to fulfill these growing needs. He points to the brand s innovative menu Smoothie King introduced Greek Yogurt into its offerings; added a protein-packed plant-based vegan line; and even added a decadent Ghirardelli dark chocolate blend made with 100 percent cacao and only four grams of fat.

So far, the brand s world-wide praise is a good indicator that Kim and his team are doing something right customers recently voted Smoothie King the No. 1 brand in the Limited-Service Restaurant Beverage-Snack category in the 2016 edition of Nation s Restaurant News  Consumer Picks issue. To win the title, Smoothie King beat out brands like Krispy Kreme, Starbucks and Dunkin  Donuts.

Even still, Kim believes that this is just the beginning for Smoothie King. As the brand continues to target more growth and more territories, Kim s goal is to further spread Smoothie King s mission so it becomes a household name synonymous with great-tasting, nutritious smoothies. In the same way that people can name their favorite gym when talking about working out or a favorite brand when looking for running shoes, Kim wants Smoothie King to be top of mind when it comes to finding a quick and healthy option that people can feel good about.

 I think Smoothie King can set a new bar for the way we think about food. Our healthy and active lifestyle culture is something that people need right now, and I truly believe we can dominate the world in that category,  Kim said.  What makes our brand so unique is that we are built with a strong team that really believes that the more stores we put out into the world, the more people we can reach and the more people we can inspire to lead a better life. At Smoothie King, we are proud to truly embody what we say with what we do.

 Taken together, these factors boil down to the notion that cats should not be eating from bowls. Plopping a scoop of food into a bowl is not enough! 
 In their natural environment, cats eat about 12 times a day, feasting on small prey like mice and birds that are appropriate for their stomachs, which are about the size of a table tennis ball. They also toss their prey around in a form of play that is essential to their well-being.

196,Expanding the reach of Asian noodles,"              Save 10% on  Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities  using code PFNOODLES. Purchase the report  here .  
  July 18 -  Generally speaking, consumers express interest in new culinary experiences; however, some trepidation remains when it comes to actually  trying  different foods from other cultures. Through innovation, Asian noodle marketers can help bridge the gap between interest and trial, according to Packaged Facts in the report    Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities   . 
 As suggested by our survey results, those who eat Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. The willingness to explore new food options skews higher among those who eat Asian noodles at a restaurant. 
 Once again, this reinforces the idea that restaurants are often a point of entry in ethnic food exploration. So it s not surprising to find that Asian noodle users tend to strongly agree that they enjoy eating foreign foods at a restaurant and often try different foods from other cultures. 
 Some degree of food adventurousness is required to gain knowledge and experience, which can then prompt continued food exploration. 
  As suggested by our survey results, those who believe they possess a strong knowledge of Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. This implies that the willingness to explore new food options and culinary experiences leads to increased confidence and knowledge in other cuisines. 
 Conversely, those who claim they have no Asian noodle knowledge are also less adventurous when it comes to trying new foods/recipes or showing interest in other cultures and foreign foods. 
  To better attract those who are less willing to experiment in food and culture, providing customized options allowing guests to select familiar ingredients will likely have the best opportunity as a point of entry for these new users.  
 Consider the expanding noodle chain Wagamama, which frames its brand as presenting staple modern Asian cuisine delivering fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. The company leverages authenticity while understanding menu explanation is important to help guests feel comfortable with its brand and menu. For example, Teppanyaki is a menu section that offers this explanation to help patrons to increase noodle knowledge and encourage trial:  Teppanyaki is a big plate of sizzling noodles, stir-fried by quickly turning them on a flat griddle. This means you get soft noodles and crunchy vegetables.  
  The bottom line  
 By leveraging limited-time offers, seasonal menus, and other menu strategies that play to variety and change, restaurants play a significant role in shaping society s comfort with trying the new and different when it comes to foreign/ethnic foods. 
 For packaged food marketers, noodle opportunity involves utilizing brand extension, cobranding partnerships and premiumization to gain traction and encourage consumers to explore this type of culinary innovation at home.

200,Millennials: Unbanked but bankable?,"              Packaged Facts is your trusted source for market research on the financial services industry. We cover topics ranging from financial services for small businesses to debit &amp; credit cards to mobile payments. See our full catalog of related reports  here .   
  June 27 -  Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts    Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers   report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships. 
 Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons. 
 However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century. 
   Many Millennials fit this description .   
 Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models. 
 But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it: 
  In 2008, some 20% of unbanked 18-34s had nevertheless used a bank, a credit union or a savings &amp; loan institution in the past 12 months for some other kind of product or service. 
 In 2015, the percentage of unbanked 18-34s using these financial institutions for something else had risen to 37.5%.

June 27 - Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts  Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships.

Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons.

However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century.

Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models.

But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it:

  June 20 -  The Millennial generation has become a driving force in the American pet industry.  Between 2007 and 2015, Millennials were responsible for 43% of the growth in the number of pet owners in the United States.  The 43 million pet owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group now account for around one in three pet owners, according to Packaged Facts in the report   Millennials as Pet Market Consumers .  
 Millennial consumers will play an even more significant role in the pet industry over the next decade.  The accelerating aging of the American population threatens to shift the consumer landscape for the pet industry because pet ownership traditionally has declined precipitously after the age of 60.  Although aging Boomers will still account for the largest share of growth in the population of pet owners, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in the market for pet products and services.  According to Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data, more than four in 10 (44%) Millennials don t have a pet now but hope to have one in the future.  Packaged Facts projects that the Millennial generation will be responsible for adding 2.6 million pet owners between 2015 and 2020.  
 Packaged Facts    Millennials as Pet Market Consumers   provides important insights for marketers trying to understand the mindset of 18- to 34-year-old pet owners.  For one thing, Millennial pet owners demonstrate an overwhelming urge to pamper their pets.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, they are much more likely than other pet owners to agree  I would rather spend money on pet toys and other products for my pets than on things for myself.   Millennials also are much more likely to  splurge  once in a while on an item for their pets and to enjoy purchasing products that pamper their pets.   So it is not surprising that Simmons National Consumer Study data show that both dog and cat owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are much more likely than other pet owners to buy toys and fashion accessories for their pets. 
 Millennials want pets they can pick up and carry wherever they go.  Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data show that 18- to 34-year-olds are much more likely to prefer to have a small pet  you can take with you more places.   Thus, dog owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are more likely than other dog owners to have small dogs weighing less than 25 pounds and much less likely to have dogs weighing over 40 pounds. 
 Millennials are more likely to coddle their pets when they feed them.  Around 30% of Millennial dog or cat owners prepare home-cooked meals for their pets, compared to just 19% of dog owners and 10% of cat owners in the 35- and-over age group.  Millennial dog or cat owners are more likely to prepare side dishes to add interest and nutrition to pre-made pet food.  Millennials also spend more money than other pet owners on treats and chews for their dogs or cats, suggesting that they especially like to reward their pets with treats and chews. 
 Millennials also appear to be a bit more obsessive about the health and safety of their pets.  For example, Millennial dog or cat owners express an elevated concern about the possibility of feeding their pets contaminated foods.  Besides being more involved in providing home-cooked foods for their pets, they are much more likely than other pet owners to use raw pet food or pet foods with formulations geared toward enhancing the health of their pets, such as organic, natural or non-GMO. 
 Moreover, compared to their older counterparts, 18- to 34-year-old pet owners are more fixated on keeping an eye on their pets.  They are much more likely to employ a wide range of technologies to track the activities of their pets and monitor the status of their health, including webcams, smartphone or tablet apps, collars with a tracking device and motion/sound sensors. 
 In short, compared to other pet owners, Millennials are more likely to be anxious about the health and safety of their pets.  They also are more inclined to pamper, coddle and keep their pets with them whenever they can, while using technology to keep an eye on them when they are away from home.  If this sounds like pets play the role of surrogate children for many Millennials, it s because they do.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, the vast majority (71%) agree that having a pet is a good way to get ready for having a family.  Thus, for many 18- to 34-year-olds owning a pet is part of their transitioning into creating a family.  So, for many Millennials it may just be that looking out for Fido and taking care of Fifi is simply a way to get ready for bringing up baby.

202,The big reversal on GMO labeling,"              June 10 -  Four years ago, a referendum, California Proposition_37, Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food, was added to the November 2012 ballot. Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural."" 
 As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum. 
 The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills. 
 Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.  
 The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016. 
 The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law. 
 At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling. 
 Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients. Not only will all of its vegetables, fruit cups and most tomato products be non-GMO, so, too, will the added ingredients used as sweeteners. The company indicated that more than 15 products will become non-GMO and be labeled as such. 
 Pointing the way for the other companies that would follow its lead, Campbell s insisted that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. However, the company issued a statement that read in part:  We have always believed that consumers have the right to know what s in their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue reaching a critical mass of 92% of consumers in favor of putting it on the label.  A sample label was prepared to indicate how Campbell would comply with the Vermont law and any future national legislation.  
 Campbell could also have pointed out that not only is there is not great support for GMO labeling, but in fact consumers are increasingly basing their food product purchasing decisions on whether or not there are GMO ingredients present. Packaged Facts research indicates that from 2013 to 2015 the percent of consumers who buy grocery products specifically labeled as non-GMO increased from over 29% to almost 39% while the percent who bought groceries labeled as organic in part to avoid GMO ingredients went from 27% to 35%. 
 Campbell indicated it would support a national standard for non-GMO claims made on food packaging, noting that a national standard  would better inform consumers and would preempt numerous state labeling efforts, which are incomplete, impractical and confusing.  In deciding to back the labeling legislation Campbell announced it will withdraw from all efforts led by coalitions and groups opposing such measures. It called on all parties involved to come together and help create a workable national labeling plan. 
 One has to wonder if the Senate had voted to support legislation banning state GMO labeling laws if Campbell and the others that came out for GMO labeling would have done so. By its own admission, Campbell was aware that the vast majority of American consumers want labeling. It must also be aware that the percent of consumers actively seeking out non-GMO products is steadily increasing. 
 Perhaps the real issue is transparency. Americans seem to have lost their trust in large institutions: government, banks, and corporations. By fighting against GMO labeling, the food industry may have given more credibility to the notion that something is wrong with GMO ingredients than the anti-GMO forces were able to do. The companies that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting Prop 37 and the state-by-state efforts that followed might have done better for themselves with consumers by going along with GMO labeling four years ago when it would have seemed more credible for them to say,  GMOs are safe but we re happy to give you what you want.

204,Packaging innovations help sell foods and beverages,"              Save 10% on   Food and Beverage Packaging Innovation in the U.S.: Consumer Perspectives   with discount code PFFBPICP through July 1.  
  June 1 -  Dramatic changes in demographics, lifestyles, and eating patterns are helping to drive packaging innovations. Among the mega-trends feeding into package development are changing population distribution, fewer married couples, more people living alone, smaller household size, and multi-generational households. These demographic shifts are leading to changes in household dynamics and eating behaviors, such as multi-shopper households, more meals being eaten alone, and snacking more often and on more occasions. Also changing is the balance between perishable foods merchandised in stores  so-called  perimeter departments  vs. shelf-stable and frozen foods merchandised in the center-store aisles. Yet another influence is the rise in smaller-footprint stores. 
 With one- or two-person households now representing 61% of all U.S. households, packages sized to serve one or two people are a big trend.  Such formats include single-serve fare, meals for two, multi-packs of individual portions, and resealable packages. A growing number of marketers are packaging fresh produce for on-the-go snacking convenience. Resealable, stand-up packaging is booming because it stands out on store shelves, saves space both at retail and in consumers  kitchens, and allows consumers to use only what they need, while the rest can remain fresh for future meals. Marketers are also switching to pouches to give their brands a more contemporary look to appeal to Millennial consumers. At the same time, smaller sizes are springing onto retail shelves as a way to control portion size and reduce calories per serve, particularly in snack foods and beverages. The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., and Dr Pepper Snapple Group all offer a variety of their carbonated soft drink brands in 7.5-ounce mini cans. 
 According to Packaged Facts     Food and Beverage Packaging Innovation in the U.S.: Consumer Perspectives   , almost seven out of 10 people say freshness, followed by food safety, are their highest priorities in food and beverage packaging.  The top three features consumers want in food and beverage packaging are tamper-proof, easy to open, and resealable. Other packaging benefits popular among consumers are portability, lighter weight, and no-mess dispensing. 
 When it comes to communicating values, an increasing number of marketers are putting their products in packages that are see-thru or have see-thru windows. Transparency in packaging taps into consumer desire for transparency about how food and beverages are produced both figuratively and literally as companies that are transparent about their ingredients, sourcing, and business practices reap the benefits in consumer goodwill and trust.  
 Eco-friendly packaging is also growing, especially for single-serve bottled water, which has come under attack by environmentalists in recent years as epitomizing the wasteful nature of modern society. Recent innovations in eco-friendly packaging include Coca-Cola s PlantBottle, which the company calls the world s first PET plastic bottle created solely from plant-based materials, and Nestle Waters North America s new bottle for its Resource Natural Spring Water, which is made from 100% recycled materials. 
 From in-store purchase through consumption, packaging for food and beverages is evolving to intersect with consumer needs and desires. Besides containing and protecting the contents, packaging serves as a billboard to make products stand out from their competition on store shelves and to communicate marketers  values. No wonder, then, that categories and brands are benefiting significantly when marketers merge consumer trends with packaging innovation.

The drugmaker s CEO, Mark Thompson, is suing Marc Cohodes--a former employee of short-selling hedge fund Rocker Partners--for libel, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Thompson is seeking $4 million Canadian dollars, alleging in documents reviewed by the WSJ that he has  suffered damage to his reputation and feelings  thanks to  false and defamatory statements  by Cohodes.

It all started with an April TV appearance by Cohodes on a Canadian financial news channel. He brought up Thompson s employment history at Biovail--now part of Valeant--which in 2008 paid $10 million to U.S. securities regulators to settle accounting fraud charges.

 The management of Concordia, their past gig was at something called Biovail, which I was short a long time ago [and] was a complete and utter fraud. So [Mr.] Thompson has a history of nonsense when he was at Biovail,  Cohodes said.

The way Thompson sees it, those statements were understood to mean that he himself had committed fraud while at Biovail. And as he argues in the lawsuit, Cohodes  has launched a campaign to manipulate downward the price of Concordia shares by, among other things, criticizing Mr. Thompson. 

Meanwhile, shares of Concordia--which has been tagged as a mini-Valeant thanks to its similar strategy, which includes price hikes, rampant M&A and a large debt load--have taken a beating over the past 12 months, sinking by nearly 80%, the WSJ notes.

And Concordia isn t alone. Specialty peers Mallinckrodt, Endo, Horizon and others have all suffered on the stock market since Valeant s own decline began last year. That downfall, set in motion by governmental drug-pricing pushback, was propelled by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who in October claimed Valeant had used its specialty pharmacy network to inflate its top line.

But not ulcerative colitis--and now it s got new data that could help make that expansion a reality.

Friday, the pharma giant announced that Xeljanz beat out placebo in a Phase III maintenance study, posting a significantly higher proportion of patients in remission at week 52.

It s good news for Pfizer, which is currently looking at fewer potential frontiers for growth than it was just a year ago. Last October, it announced it was nixing development projects for the med in Crohn s and ankylosing spondylitis--and reconsidering its desire to play in the crowded psoriasis marketplace, too.

Instead, it said, it would double down on rheumatoid arthritis, the med s current indication, and focus development efforts on UC and psoriatic arthritis to help the slow starter pick up the pace.  And since then, it s rolled out data from a pair of other studies that met their primary endpoints, too, which bodes well for the fate of a future regulatory submission package.

That s not to say Xeljanz would be without its hefty rivals if it did snag a UC nod. AbbVie s Humira, which tops the list of world s best-selling drugs, would be among them. But unlike the AbbVie blockbuster, Xeljanz is a pill--and it s also the first in its class of JAK inhibitors to be studied in the chronic condition, which affects millions of patients around the world.

What gives? | FiercePharmaEver since they hit the market within weeks of each other in 2014, Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb s cancer immunotherapies have been running neck-and-neck when it comes to FDA approvals and new data. But sales? Not so much.

In 2015, Merck s Keytruda brought in $566 million, an impressive total to be sure. But Opdivo racked up several hundred million more at $942 million.

And that trend has only continued. Opdivo recorded $840 million in second quarter sales, more than twice Keytruda s $314 million. For the first quarter, Opdivo posted $704 million, while Keytruda managed $249 million. That brings the drugs  first-half tallies to $1.58 billion and $563 million, respectively.

What s going on? After all, the two meds do have similar lists of indications in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. They re both on their way to new uses in head and neck cancer, too. The big difference in their labeling is that, in lung cancer, Keytruda is supposed to be given to patients who test positive for certain levels of the PD-L1 biomarker, and Opdivo is approved for use regardless of PD-L1 status.

And that s holding Merck back on market share in lung cancer, not only in its current target market--patients who ve failed on at least one prior treatment--but in off-label use in previously untreated patients. Right now, 70% of Keytruda sales derive from melanoma, with 10% to 15% coming in second-line lung cancer. In previously untreated patients--where Merck expects eventual growth, once it wins a first-line approval-- the utilization ... right now is very low,  Merck EVP Adam Schechter said during the Q2 earnings call.

Meanwhile, doctors are bringing Opdivo to previously untreated patients more quickly. On the company s second-quarter call with analysts, Bristol-Myers executives said doctors  off-label use of Opdivo has given the drug 10% to 15% of the first-line market in squamous lung cancer and about 5% in non-squamous patients, a much bigger market.

But BMS admits that, as both drugs win their coveted first-line lung-cancer approvals, Opdivo s advantage there could wane. In that field, up-front PD-L1 diagnostic testing will apply to both meds--and that means both companies will be pushing doctors to run those diagnostics.

More testing means more opportunity for Keytruda to win scripts, Schechter said, and right now, doctors seem to be enthusiastic about Keytruda in PD-L1-positive patients.

 [W]hat s important is we're seeing PD-L1 testing start to occur more and more often,  he said on the call, adding that two-thirds of physicians are now testing.  And what we see is when physicians test, they tend to use Keytruda, and that's where we see the utilization of Keytruda for lung right now. 

Unfortunately for Merck, however, Bristol-Myers is moving toward another first-line lung-cancer approval--this time for Opdivo alongside its other immunotherapy, Yervoy. In data rolled out at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June, the two meds together boosted response rates in lung cancer patients, compared with Opdivo alone.

In the second quarter, new respiratory meds pulled in  243 million, with ICS/LABA combo med Breo generating  146 million of the haul. Meanwhile, Advair sales--which have taken a beating over the past few years under payer pressure--dropped only  60 million for the period.

It s good news for the drugmaker, which has faced plenty of criticism from those who doubted Breo and fellow newcomer Anoro could ever reach the blockbuster sales Glaxo had outlined. And a slow start for both meds did little to assuage their fears. Now, though, Breo--helped by improved coverage and an asthma indication it picked up last year--is coming into its own.

Of course, there s a caveat when it comes to filling Advair s shoes. The med hasn t actually faced generic attackers in the U.S. yet, and while copycat drugmakers--including Mylan and the U.K. s Vectura--are getting in line for approval, it s unclear when they ll win an all-clear from regulators.

Witty has stressed time and again, though, that the generic threat may not actually be so big. Because of aggressive payer tactics, GSK has already offered up deep price cuts on its star product, which he says have mimicked the genericization effect.

Knockoffs will definitely arrive after Witty hands over the chief exec reins in March, though,  and I will therefore spend my entire career as CEO of GSK saying the same thing, which is that the genericization of Advair is not going to be normal,  he told investors on the Q2 conference call.

The company isn t taking any chances, though; it s continuing to stock its respiratory pipeline with future backups. Last week, it announced it would shell out up to  175 million ($230 million) to get its hands on a Phase I severe asthma candidate from Johnson & Johnson s Janssen.

In an internal memo to McCann staffers, McCann Worldgroup CEO Harris Diamond wrote that  RB, whose business spans the Health, Hygiene and Home categories, has been growing organically with us including at McCann Health, based on their recognition of the value of our creative and strategic work in building their brands. 

McCann Worldgroup picked up global assignments for two RB germ protection brands, Lysol and Dettol, shifting the work from Havas Worldwide, which will still continue to work for RB in a newly named role as  lead strategic and creative partner for new strategic initiatives. 

Amar Urhekar, president of McCann Health Americas, deferred to Worldgroup on his agency s contribution to the win, but did talk to FiercePharmaMarketing about the effect of the changing dynamics in health and pharma marketing that are bringing healthcare agencies closer to consumer agencies.

 When we say healthcare marketing or communications, the mind goes predominantly to Rx or pure pharma work. But it s not about pure Rx any more, it s more about managing health in the larger context of  overall health, wellness and well-being,  he said.

Those changes mean that healthcare agencies are more often targeting consumer audiences and working more closely across network sibling agencies. McCann Health now works often with digital agency MRM/McCann, brand experience agency Momentum, and traditional agency McCann, to name a few, Urhekar said.

But he did emphasize that even though healthcare work is becoming more patient-centric, it still requires back-end industry expertise in decoding and communicating science, as well as navigating and following regulations.

 That is truly going to be the agency model of the future for us where we remain the experts at the core of who we are and what we do, but then we add on more seamless services from other parts of the McCann Worldgroup network,  Urhekar said.

The world s best-selling drug continued its hot streak, posting worldwide sales of $4.15 billion--a year-over-year increase of more than 17%--to best consensus estimates of $3.93 billion. And that performance, in turn, drove a $250 million top-line beat--with revenues hitting $6.45 billion--as well as forecast-topping adjusted diluted EPS of $1.26.

Much of Humira s sales beat came from the Illinois drugmaker s home country, but the med also exceeded international expectations by $40 million despite some new rivals. Outside-the-U.S. sales  continue to impress in the face of competition from Remicade and Enbrel biosimilars in the EU,  Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a note to clients.

While biosimilars may not be threatening sales abroad, though, Humira has plenty of challengers that are hoping to bite into its U.S. sales--including Amgen, which recently scored an FDA panel s backing for its version of the blockbuster. But as CEO Richard Gonzalez told investors on the quarterly conference call, AbbVie has  a large portfolio  of IP surrounding its star product,  and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset. 

Meanwhile, Humira didn t get the job done on its own. Imbruvica, the cancer hotshot AbbVie shelled out $21 billion to get its hands on, also surpassed forecasts, pulling in $439 million to the $430 million analysts expected.

As for hep C combo treatment Viekira Pak, though, its struggles continued at home, where it managed just $87 million in sales. The therapy  continues to be weak in the U.S.,  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a note, in part because AbbVie refused to match the lowest price put forward in public channels by Merck for new entrant Zepatier.

 We've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCV,  Gonzalez acknowledged.

For now, though, AbbVie s confident its other products--and pipeline--will be able to guide it through a Humira biosimilar attack when the time comes.  We ve spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline ... that would allow us to go through even the most bearish impact that s out there from an analyst standpoint around biosimilars,  Gonzalez said.

And it feels good about the current year s prospects, too. It tweaked its adjusted diluted EPS guidance range upward, taking it to $4.73 to $4.83 from $4.62 to $4.82.

Deep in its quarterly report filed today with the SEC, Lilly said it has  received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents and information relating to our contracts with, services performed by and payments to pharmacy benefit managers.  It said it was cooperating with the investigation.

In an email, Eli Lilly declined to comment beyond its filing.

It has not been clear what exactly the DOJ is looking for, although in the past drugmakers such as Novartis ($NVS) and AstraZeneca ($AZN) have agreed to pay fines and penalties to settle allegations they had offered a quid pro quo to PBMs for preferred formulary status.

Last fall, Valeant disclosed it had received a DOJ inquiry about its financial support to patients, drug distribution and pricing decisions, followed in March by a similar disclosure from Horizon Pharma ($HZNP). But that was Valeant and Horizon, whose relationships with closely related specialty pharmacies seemed to draw special interest.

Then in a series of financial filings in May, it became clear that whatever the DOJ was hoping to find, it was looking for throughout the industry. Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) Merck & Co. and Endo International all said they were being asked for info.

J&J, whose Janssen unit was the one to receive the demand for information, didn t specify which drugs might be involved. But Merck said investigators asked it for information on payments related to the migraine drug Maxalt and the erectile dysfunction drug Levitra from 2006 to the present. In the case of Endo, the U.S. Attorney s office demand info on PBM contracts covering Frova, also a migraine drug.

And that forecast certainly held strong in Q2, with the blockbuster--alongside hot new immunotherapy Keytruda--helping the pharma giant meet Wall Street s expectations.

Revenues checked in at $9.84 billion, ever-so-slightly topping the $9.78 billion analysts predicted. And non-GAAP EPS, in turn, hit 93 cents, surpassing forecasts by two cents to make for what Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum called a  reasonable  quarter.

Januvia and sister med Janumet--which continued  to hold up better than we had previously expected in the face of increased competition""--were a big reason why, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a Friday note to clients. The DPP-4 superstar franchise raked in $1.63 billion for the quarter to pass consensus of $1.57 billion, and it did so despite the threat from SGLT2 product Jardiance, which last year showed it could cut the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death.

 The Januvia franchise continues living in positive growth territory --at about 2% year-over-year-- despite SGLT2s,  Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson wrote to clients. But that may change if Jardiance manages to get its cardiovascular death data added to its label, a change that s currently pending at the FDA.

Keytruda sales also surprised analysts, coming in $22 million above where they thought they d be at $314 million. The hotshot med has been battling it out with Bristol-Myers Squibb s Opdivo in melanoma and lung cancer, racing to pick up new indications and break into earlier lines of therapy. On that front, Merck is working to snag a go-ahead in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer, and  the attentions of investors in the coming year will focus on that indication,  Schoenebaum wrote.

In hepatitis C, a field the New Jersey drugmaker recently broke into with combo product Zepatier, things are so far going as planned. Revenues of $112 million were more or less in line, though the big test for the drug--which is facing down nemesis Harvoni from Gilead and Viekira Pak from AbbVie--will come when payer contracts are renegotiated for next year, Schoenebaum said.

And Merck will need those sellers to keep coming through if it wants to return to growth. Divan, for one, expects to see gains from Keytruda and Zepatier erased by declines from Remicade--which, facing new biosimilar competition, saw sales decline by about 3% quarter-over-quarter--and Januvia.

For now, though, Merck saw enough positives to narrow its guidance ranges. It now expects full-year revenue to come in between $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion, up from a prior $39.0 billion to $40.2 billion range. And on the EPS side, it s predicting a mark between $3.67 and $3.77, up from the $3.65 to $3.77 brackets it earlier outlined.

Wednesday, the Massachusetts biotech reported SG&A costs that increased 23% year-over-year. While some of that spend went toward Vertex s CF pipeline, the company put the rest behind  commercial support for Orkambi,  Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note Thursday. But it paid off, with the med s revenues picking up by 10% over the year-ago quarter to hit a $245 million mark that fell in line with forecasts.

That increase will  likely to come as a relief to investors after a disappointing early slowing in Orkambi s growth trajectory,  Porges noted, and he also expects the results to provide a tailwind heading into the second half of the year, when execs on the Q2 conference call  repeatedly emphasized that incremental revenue opportunities and regulatory events were likely. 

Among them: A label expansion for the tandem med to include children aged 6 to 11 with two copies of the delta 508 mutation. The FDA is currently reviewing Vertex s bid, with a PDUFA date for Sept. 30. And if it wins a green light--an event Porges expects-- we expect to be ready to bring Orkambi to these patients immediately,  CEO Jeffrey Leiden told investors.

While an FDA go ahead could help Vertex reach about 2,400 children in the U.S., there are even more young patients eligible for the therapy in Europe, Leiden estimated, pegging the tally at about 3,400. There, the drugmaker plans to submit its application for approval in the first half of next year, which could result in an early 2018 regulatory clearance.

Though in Europe, it hasn't been all smooth sailing when it comes to snagging reimbursement coverage. Last month, England's cost watchdogs turned down the med and its  104,000 ($147,000) pricetag for routine NHS use.

But it wasn t the usual suspects getting the job done.

Thursday, the New Jersey drugmaker announced results that Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum labeled  reasonable,  with sales checking in at $4.87 billion--about 5% ahead of analyst estimates--and EPS that topped forecasts by 4.5% to reach 69 cents.

But the drivers for those beats were  different than what we expected,  as Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan put it in a note to clients. While sales of quick-launching Opdivo beat Wall Street s predictions overall at $840 million, its $643 million stateside haul fell short of the anticipated $661.2 mark. Yervoy sales of $241 million were about 10% off of Wall Street s expectations, too, and next-gen anticoagulant Eliquis, a key growth driver recently, didn t turn out any surprises.

But  less strategically important  products such as chemo treatment Sprycel and HIV therapy Reyataz picked up the slack, Divan wrote, while Bristol s hep C franchise continued to raise eyebrows, coming in $191 million above consensus with $546 million in sales to drive most of the top-line beat. That figure s less surprising if you consider that Gilead recorded a similarly significant beat on Q2 revenues of Sovaldi, which can be prescribed with Bristol s Daklinza, Schoenebaum noted.

But Bristol's hep C glory isn't likely to last, given hefty competition in the hep C arena from Gilead, AbbVie and newcomer Merck, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said.  This franchise continues to hold in fairly well, yet seems destined for a slow-down due to changing competitive dynamics,  he wrote in a Thursday note.

The Q2 performance was enough to help Bristol tweak its guidance for the year, if only modestly. It raised the midpoint by 2%, forecasting an EPS mark between $2.55 and $2.65; that s up from a prior $2.50 to $2.60 prediction, and consensus currently pegs EPS at $2.57, Anderson wrote.

With billions in sales under biosimilar threat and facing investor pressure to make M&A moves, Amgen on Wednesday posted revenue and earnings beats for the second quarter. The results, boosted by pharma s much-maligned price increases, were enough for the California biotech to raise its guidance following a solid first half.

Amgen ($AMGN) reported Enbrel sales growth of 10% to $1.48 billion in the second quarter, a rise driven by price increases that were offset somewhat by competition, executives explained on a conference call. Amgen raised Enbrel's price by 28% last year and another 9.9% as of July 1, the Wall Street Journal said last month, citing an analyst report.

The outperformance from Enbrel underlines the danger biosimilars pose to Amgen's top line. And Enbrel is among the bigger targets for biosimilar developers: Earlier this month, a knockoff version from Novartis' Sandoz unit captured a recommendation from an FDA panel of experts, paving the way for an agency approval. Sandoz will have to survive any patent challenges before launching, however.

Amgen's total second-quarter revenue of $5.69 billion bested consensus by about $100 million, while EPS of $2.84 beat consensus by 12 cents. With the results, Amgen raised its revenue guidance for 2016 to between $22.5 billion and $22.8 billion, up from previous guidance of between $22.2 billion and $22.6 billion. The company bumped its expected EPS up to between $11.10 and $11.40 from a previous range of $10.85 to $11.20.

In a note titled  Price Is A Man s Best Friend,  Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges said Amgen had a  nice quarter,  but the biotech  appears to be benefiting from price and demand tailwinds in the near-term, despite competition and healthcare cost debates.  He added that Amgen  is challenged by increasing competitive risks and uncertainties, with limited pipeline upside to offset them. 

And pipeline concerns are exactly what s created M&A pressure for Amgen and some peers. On Wednesday, Amgen CFO David Meline said the company is looking at deals that would bring in meds ranging from early to late stages.

 We've got a number of pretty interesting prospects that we think could come to closure including still this year,  he said.

Aside from Enbrel, the California biotech posted sizable sales gains for the multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis, rare leukemia therapy Blinctyo and bone drug Prolia, each up more than 30% on the period.

Even though Kyprolis sales grew 45% versus last year, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a note that the performance looked  somewhat weak."" Doctors might be prescribing Johnson & Johnson's ($JNJ) new rival med Darzalex, approved to treat patients who've failed on three prior treatments, off-label for patients who've relapsed after just one regimen, Schoenebaum suggested.

Under biosimilar attack from the first approved U.S. biosim in Sandoz s Zarxio, Amgen s Neupogen sales fell 23% to $196 million on the period, though executives pledged to continue competing  account by account  by emphasizing the med s track record and reliable supply. Porges said Neupogen sales  eroded quicker than anticipated,  missing consensus estimates by 8%.

Having just won an FDA committee backing for its own biosimilar of AbbVie ($ABBV) megablockbuster Humira, Amgen offered no new details about its launch plans. CEO Bob Bradway said the company would wait for an FDA approval before outlining further launch plans.

Sandoz's own panel nod for biosim Enbrel came just one day after Amgen's Humira biosim cruised through a committee vote earlier this month.

For the second straight quarter, his much-maligned growth strategy has come through for the drugmaker, which delivered beats on both earnings and revenue.

Sales for the quarter rose by 4% in constant currencies to hit  6.5 billion, topping analyst expectations by about  200 million, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson wrote in a note to clients. And all three of the company s units contributed to growth, with vaccines and consumer health making 11% and 7% jumps, respectively.

Glaxo went out on a limb back in 2013 to bulk up in those units, trading away its assets in oncology--a fast-growing, en vogue field--to Novartis in return for the Swiss drugmaker s vaccines and an OTC partnership. The way Witty saw it, he could increase volume in the traditionally low-margin businesses while dodging the pricing pressure that s increasingly hurting pharma units across the industry--though investors weren t convinced.

Now, though,  the rebuilding of GSK is well underway,  Anderson wrote, with those units playing a big role in the turnaround. But the company s pharma division--which represented another big question mark after its cancer drugs changed hands--also churned out its fair share of sales.

New products  were all ahead of expectations,  Anderson wrote--meaning it wasn t just GSK s HIV standouts buoying the unit, as they have in recent quarters. Those meds did continue their hot streak, with Triumeq putting up sales of  409 million and Tivicay chipping in with  225 million. But respiratory therapy Breo also surpassed predictions with  146 million--helping GSK s respiratory portfolio offset declines from aging giant Advair for the first time ever.

The revenue boost showed through on the bottom line, too, where EPS climbed 24.5 pence in constant currencies. And on that front, Glaxo tweaked its guidance for the year slightly upward, narrowing its previously guided range; it now expects core EPS percentage growth of between 11% and 12% instead of the 10% to 12% range it earlier forecast.

With Witty set to step down next March, it'll be up to the company's as-yet-unnamed incoming CEO to keep the expansion coming--and Witty doesn't intend to tell the newcomer what to do when he hands over the reins. ""The last thing a new CEO wants is an instruction manual from a predecessor,"" he told investors on the earnings conference call.

But whatever path the company takes in Witty's absence, his successor--who won't face the ""constant stream"" of patent expirations that the drugmaker's seen over the past 7 to 8 years--will be well set up for the future.

""The new CEO has the platform to be able to build growth and focus on how to drive those elements of growth in the vaccine, consumer and pharmaceutical businesses without having to always be taking two steps back before they take one step forward,"" he said.

As if to emphasize its commitment, the drugmaker today said it intends to put a big chunk of money into expanding its manufacturing there.

GSK will invest  275 million ($360.3 million) in its sites at Barnard Castle in Durham County, Montrose in Scotland and Ware in Hertfordshire to expand production of new respiratory drugs and biopharmaceuticals. The company said it expected the expansion to lead to some unknown number of new jobs and provide further work for the 2,750 people already working at the three sites.

The company said there were plenty of reasons to feel good about new U.K. investments. It lauded the U.K. s place in the pharma world and the benefits of the so-called patent box tax legislation from several years ago which taxes at a lower rate profits on new intellectual property created in the U.K.

 It is testament to our skilled U.K. workforce and the country s leading position in life sciences that we are making these investments in advanced manufacturing here,  GSK CEO Andrew Witty, who will retire next year, said in a statement.

Specifically, GSK said it will invest  92 million at Barnard Castle to build an aseptic sterile manufacturing plant for biologics,  110 million to expand API production for HIV drugs and vaccines at the Scotland plant and  74 million at the Ware site for expansion of production of inhalers for its Ellipta respiratory drug.

While an outlay of  275 million is not much for a company with nearly  25 billion in annual revenues, Nigel Driffield, a professor of international business at the Warwick Business School said in an emailed statement that the GSK announcement  will doubtless be seized upon by supporters of Brexit that the U.K. is still good for business,  particularly since Witty was a fierce supporter of staying in the E.U.

According to Reuters, Witty addressed the Brexit business in a call with journalists today saying that the fundamental competitiveness of the U.K. is no different today than before last month s vote to bail out of the E.U. He acknowledged there may be some disruption in drug oversight with the E.U. drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, leaving London as a result of the U.K. s decision. He also that said that the risk that the country s top scientific minds might leave the country to seek better opportunities is a ""question-mark we should all be concerned about.""

The host group doesn't have healthcare concerns, or even political ones. It tapped Digitas Health LifeBrands, which is headquartered in Philadelphia, for its digital and social expertise, as well as its local connections, to run the host committee s celebration and reception of the political fest in historic Philly. But nevertheless, Digitas Health Exec VP of Connected Health Brendan Gallagher is still hoping that healthcare brands pay attention to what the agency is doing this week.

 What the team is doing there with the host committee is essentially role modeling the type of work we want our brands to start engaging in more,  he told FiercePharmaMarketing in an interview.    Content marketing is becoming one of the biggest drivers in marketing. It s expected to be a $300 billion business by 2019, and we expect our healthcare brands to be engaging in it more and more. 

With more than 50,000 people converging on Philadelphia, along with countless others following the event online, Digitas Health should have ample opportunity to showcase its skills. The agency s group director of brand communications strategy, Annie Heckenberger, is overseeing the DNC host committee s social strategy, as well as about 200 social volunteers, over the convention s 8-day run.

The nontraditional hire of a healthcare and pharma agency may also point to the mainstreaming of health specialty agencies. ""Power of One,"" the initiative of Digitas parent company Publicis Groupe to encourage its agencies to work across specialties and silos, has worked to spur that more general recognition, Gallagher said.

 This industry has been a sleeping giant for a really long time,  Gallagher said.  One of the things we like to say is  health is the new wealth.  Everybody s getting into healthcare. And the disruption that s happening within the industry is attracting new levels of talent and new types of expertise.   We re getting into product and service design, social content marketing and experiential marketing, which is driving better experiences for our brands and their customers.

But that could all change soon.

Johnson & Johnson's Darzalex now has a chance to leapfrog into second-line use, a much bigger market than its current approved indication. The drug nabbed the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation as a treatment for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed after at least one prior therapy, the company said Tuesday.

In these patients, Darzalex would be combined with the chemo drug dexamethasone and either Celgene s Revlimid or Takeda s Velcade.

Right now, Darzalex is restricted to the fourth-line setting, meaning patients don t get a crack at it until they ve failed on three or more previous regimens. If this new designation leads to a speedy thumbs up from regulators, Darzalex s patient pool will swell considerably--and bring in patients who tend to stay on therapy for longer periods of time.

It s a prospect that would certainly please J&J, which is battling it out in the next-gen field with Takeda s Ninlaro and Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie s Empliciti. All three meds were approved late last year, and so far they ve been toiling with market shares in the single digits, Amgen commercial EVP Tony Hooper told investors on the company s Q1 conference call.

But if J&J does snag a second-line nod, that'll put the heat on Amgen's Kyprolis, which only recently won its own second-line green light.  And stiffer competition is the last thing Kyprolis needs. The Big Biotech's med hasn't started off as strongly as Amgen had expected when it shelled out $10 billion for maker Onyx in 2013.

Meanwhile, J&J isn t just relying on moving up into earlier lines of therapy to keep the Darzalex expansion coming. Earlier this year, J&J announced it would team up with Roche to test its cancer-fighter with Tecentriq, a brand-new PD-L1 immunotherapy from Roche s Genentech unit.

The hedge fund, which owns about 9.9% of the California drugmaker s outstanding shares, has decided to control the timing of the special meeting, rejecting an offer by Depomed to let it call the meeting itself. As Depomed warned, it ll be a long process for Starboard to go its own route, but the proxy brawler thinks it s necessary to  prevent Depomed from any further attempts to manipulate our special meeting process and disenfranchise shareholders with needless stratagems,  its CEO, Jeffrey Smith, wrote in a letter to shareholders.

Starboard also has a couple other picks to tack onto its proposed slate of new Depomed directors, which it hopes to install when the special meeting rolls around: Robert Savage, former worldwide chairman for Johnson & Johnson s pharma group, and James Tyree, former EVP of pharma products at Abbott Labs. But because revising its nominee lineup would create further delays in setting a meeting date, Starboard is bringing them on as advisers for now.

Along with Starboard s other board picks--a group that currently includes the fund s own chief exec, Smith, and former Endo skipper Peter Lankau--Savage and Tyree would create  an all-star board that would work diligently and collaboratively to protect and represent the best interests of shareholders,  Smith wrote.

And that's not the only roster tweak Starboard wants to make if it successfully turns over the board. It's willing to include one current Depomed director on the list to ""maintain a degree of continuity amidst the required change that we believe is desperately needed at Depomed,"" Smith said.

Starboard has been railing on Depomed s corporate governance practices ever since it first took aim at the pain drug specialist. The hedge fund points to Deposed's tactics warding off a hostile takeover by Horizon as an act of  egregiously manipulating the corporate machinery to entrench management and the board. 

And the latest request from Depomed--to let it call the special meeting after Oct. 28, when patent litigation over key drug Nucynta would be all wrapped up--didn t do much to restore Starboard s faith.

The way Depomed sees it, though, shareholders need all the facts surrounding Nucynta s patent life to make an  informed voting decision,  it said last month.

Bristol-Myers and J&J s Janssen Biotech unit will put Opdivo through its paces in non-small cell lung cancer, alongside an experimental immunotherapy now dubbed JNJ-64041757. That Phase I drug is an antigen-presentation therapy based on attenuated Listeria monocytogenes virus.

The deal is part of an ongoing space race in immuno-oncology, as drugmakers anticipate a new era of cancer-fighting combination regimens and strike partnership deals in hopes of hitting upon the most effective cocktails.

Bristol-Myers and Merck & Co., currently the two leaders in immuno-oncology with the first two marketed PD-1 therapies, have each inked a slate of combination therapy deals with Big Pharma and smaller biotechs alike. Roche, which recently nabbed FDA approval for its entry, Tecentriq, has its own range of collaborations, too.

Combination immunotherapies promise better results with far fewer side effects than older treatments. They also will come at a big cost. Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda each carry list prices of about $150,000 per year, which means two- and three-drug combination regimens could come to twice that--or more. Bristol-Myers priced its Opdivo and Yervoy combo, recently approved in melanoma, at $256,000 per year. Priced separately two drugs together would cost more than $300,000 the company says.

Bristol-Myers teamed up Monday with AbbVie to trial Opdivo and its sister immunotherapy Yervoy with AbbVie s closely watched Rova-T therapy. Both that deal and the new Janssen collaboration involve Phase II trials that potentially could lead to breakthrough therapy applications for quick FDA approval.

The Janssen candidate relies on live attenuated double-deleted (LADD) strains of listeria. The strains are engineered to spur a patient s immune system to attack lung cancer tumors. It s currently in Phase I at Janssen.

Bristol-Myers has been ginning up these combo drug deals in an effort to stay ahead in the immuno-therapy field, where it's competing head-to-head with Merck & Co. s Keytruda in melanoma and lung cancer. Then there s Roche s Tecentriq (atezolizumab), which recently won an FDA nod to treat bladder cancer--an indication Opdivo also hopes to snare. Pipeline meds from Pfizer and AstraZeneca will also be looking to snag a piece of the PD-1/PD-L1 market.

Big Pharma development executives figure that partnerships in immunotherapy will yield the most effective and safest drug cocktails, given that individual drugmakers are unlikely to be experts in every hot research field. At a conference in April, AbbVie s Niels Emmerich argued that the best drug combos are likely to come out of clinical collaborations.  [I]n the end, it comes down to what are the most promising combinations, where 1 plus 1 is significantly greater than 2,  Emmerich said at the time.

Monday, Active Ownership Capital revealed its own desired boardroom edits, which include ousting Chairman Martin Abend and Deputy Chairman Carl Ferdinand Oetker, Reuters reports. Active Ownership also isn t too keen on Gunnar Riemann or Birgit Kudlek, two of Stada s prospective appointments.

Instead, the proxy brawler--which holds about a 7% Stada stake--is asking its fellow investors to support the nomination of former Novartis compliance officer Eric Cornut; one-time Hexal CEO Hans-Helmut Fabry and CFO Klaus-Joachim Krauth; and Ursula Schuetze-Kreilkamp, who specializes in coaching leadership personnel. It s fine with Stada s other two nominees, Opel exec Tina Mueller and Amgen exec Rolf Hoffmann.

Tensions between the two sides have been brewing for a while now. After appearing to strike an accord back in May--under which Active Ownership would have replaced just three board members, instead of the 5 it initially wanted--Stada decided to go its own way, announcing it would make its own picks for replacement candidates.

Now, it ll be up to shareholders to make a choice at the company s annual meeting on Aug. 26. And the way Active Ownership sees it, it s a crucial one--especially now that Stada s directors may need to replace longtime chief Hartmut Retzlaff, who took a leave of absence for health reasons in early June.

""Should Mr. Retzlaff not return, it will surely be the task of the new supervisory board to overhaul the management board in a sensible fashion,"" Active Ownership partner Florian Schuhbauer told the news service, noting that interim helmsman Matthias Wiedenfels doesn t have the industry experience necessary to run the company.

Meanwhile, though, Wiedenfels has already begun doing just that, starting off with some more shuffling of Stada s top ranks. Recently, Reuters reported that he d stripped Retzlaff s son, Steffen, of some of his duties and fired a group of external advisers.

Look no further than its HIV franchise, where the latest generation of meds is grabbing market share--and the single product Genvoya is taking on patients lickety-split.

There s a down side to that script growth--which we ll get to in a minute--but first, the numbers. After just 6 months on the market, Genvoya is already the most-prescribed HIV drug for patients new to antivirals and those switching from another regimen, COO Kevin Young said during the company s Q2 earnings call. Sales nearly doubled for the quarter compared with Q1, he said, coming in at $302 million worldwide. Overall HIV revenue grew to $3.1 billion for the period.

Genvoya  represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atripla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago,  Young told analysts on the call.

But here s a caveat: More than three-quarters (78%) of Genvoya scripts have been switches, most of them from Gilead s  quad  pill Stribild, some from its predecessor Atripla. Only 10% of those switches came from Gilead rivals.

And Gilead s even newer meds--Odefsey and Descovy--are also nabbing most of their new scripts from fellow Gilead treatments. More than 90% of those prescriptions are switches, Young said, with only 6% and 11% of those from non-Gilead meds.

The company sees those switch patients as more loyal:  Among all patients who switch, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product,  Young said. But no doubt Gilead would be happier if more patients were moving into the Gilead fold from elsewhere.

This new group of HIV meds is a follow-up to a previous generation, with one big difference: Based on a new formulation of staple med tenofovir, known as TAF, the new drugs are safer than the previous versions. That s one big reason for the mass switching.

But there s another that could fuel more switches in Q3 and beyond. Gilead hiked its prices on the older meds, a common move for drugmakers looking to usher in newer products. The idea is to tempt patients over to the next generation before patents on the older drugs expire. Building up the newer drugs ahead of time can cushion the blow from generic competition.

In a departure from its usual once-yearly price increases in January, Gilead recently raised the stickers on a range of older meds by 7% to 10%, Cowen & Co. analysts report. The price hikes make Gilead s older HIV drugs more expensive than its neophytes.

Stribild, for example, saw a 7% boost to wholesale acquisition cost as of July 1, on top of January s 5% hike. Stribild s wholesale cost now runs at $2,890 a month, more than its successor, Genvoya.

 We suspect that these increases were taken on the TDF-based regimens to help accelerate the switch from TDF to TAF in advance of TDF patent expirations beginning in 2018,  the analysts said in a recent investor note.

Gilead has been a perennial target for AIDS activists, which famously protested the costs of its earlier meds with sit-ins and other events. More recently, the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation launched a  Gilead Greed Kills!  campaign with an elaborate protest at the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference. The group lost a legal battle with Gilead over its TAF drug development timeline earlier this month, but says it plans to appeal. Meanwhile, it has asked lawmakers and the FDA to investigate the company for patent manipulation and antitrust violations.

But there s no arguing that Gilead has pushed HIV treatment forward, and the TAF generation of drugs is likely to pay off as well as previous advances did for the company, analysts say. Gilead s head-to-head HIV competitor ViiV Healthcare has been aggressive in its new drug development, with its brand-new Triumeq and Tivicay growing fast. But Gilead s TAF trio will help the California-based company  face ViiV s aggressive strategy to further strengthen its already large HIV portfolio,  GlobalData analyst David Fratoni said in a recent report.

But never fear, investors: It s expecting volume gains.

Tuesday, the Indianapolis pharma giant predicted 5% revenue growth per year through the end of the decade--welcome news for a company that s struggled to pick itself back up after patent expirations hit.

And that volume growth is already coming. For the second quarter, the company posted 10% volume expansion in its pharmaceutical unit, which took revenue up 9% year over year to reach $5.40 billion. Reported EPS rocketed upward, too, rising to 71 cents from 56 cents--a 27% increase.

Lilly, which suffered through a number of development setbacks in recent years before recently seeing some new products hit, has its new launches to thank for the Q2 performance. Cancer-fighter Cyramza leapt 79% to reach $278 million in worldwide sales, making up for a 4% U.S. slide from increased competition in non-small-cell lung cancer.

And a trio of diabetes meds came up big, too. Trulicity, the company s GLP-1 contender, hauled in $201.3 million amid an increase in market share. SGLT2 standout Jardiance--which last year became the first diabetes therapy to show it could cut the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death--netted $40.1 million. Brand-new Basaglar, the biosimilar version of Sanofi's megablockbuster Lantus, showed some early uptake success with a $16.3 million tally.

Lilly also highlighted Taltz, a next-gen psoriasis med that s generated $19.3 million since its U.S. launch in April.

The way Lilly sees it, the company couldn t be hitting its stride at a better time. As CEO John Lechleiter told CNBC Tuesday morning, he sees a future where drug pricing will be challenging across the board, meaning drugmakers won t be able to rely on the price hikes they ve so often employed in the past. Lilly has been among them: Between 2007 and 2014, the pharma took the list price of diabetes blockbuster Humulin up 354%.

Shareholders have nothing to worry about now, though, diabetes VP Mike Mason said on last quarter s conference call. The company isn t worried about net price concerns for its newer products, which should carry the company s top line going forward.

   ",http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-s-high-flying-hep-c-franchise-comes-down-to-earth-forcing-a-cut-to-2016-guidance,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 21:23:02 +0000",,"UPDATED: Analysts press for M&A as Gilead s high-flying hep C franchise comes down to earth | FiercePharmaAmid intense hep C competition, Gilead Sciences reported plummeting second-quarter sales for the megablockbuster franchise and slashed its full-year revenue forecast. The results are likely to put even more pressure on Gilead to make a game-changing deal.

Sales for Gilead s hep C drugs fell a whopping 33% to $2.3 billion in the U.S. and 32% to $775 million in Europe. The unexpected result prompted Gilead to cut 2016 sales guidance to between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, down from previous expectations of $30 billion to $31 billion.

As executives explained on a conference call with analysts Monday, the changes reflect  current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics  for hep C. The company is reaping lower revenue per patient and losing market share as fewer hep C patients start therapy.

After the results, Leerink trimmed its revenue forecast for Gilead in 2016 by 3% to 5% and reduced its earnings projection by 6%, analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note, though the figures remain above consensus. During the call,  management freely admitted their inability to gauge how long their HCV revenue might slide,  Porges said.

Analyst Mark Schoenebaum at Evercore ISI said in a note he s observed a  gradual decline with stabilization, but no floor yet,  for Gilead s hep C sales.

Predictably, questions about dealmaking followed the numbers announcement. Analysts and investors have been pressuring Gilead executives about M&A over the past few quarters, and this time around was no different. Responding to questions on the Q2 earnings call, CEO John Milligan said the company ""has been very open"" about its desire to do deals, ""especially deals of a certain size.""

Several analysts noted that Gilead plans to ratchet down on its share buybacks--thereby leaving more cash free for dealmaking. The company is said to be in the hunt for Medivation, the oncology-focused biotech that's now in play, with a host of Big Pharma and Big Biotech in pursuit. And Guggenheim analysts last week laid out a few buyout prospects, including Syntax Pharmaceuticals, Corvus Pharmaceuticals and Tesaro, which recently put up impressive data on its cancer-fighting PARP inhibitor niraparib.

The deal talk has heated up in recent quarters as concerns arose about Gilead's flagging growth, and the latest numbers only add to those worries. After revving up billions in sales from its first-to-market next-gen hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, Gilead has suffered from good old fashioned competition as first AbbVie and then Merck & Co. launched competing cocktails. Bristol-Myers Squibb's Daklinza, used in combination with Sovaldi, has also taken its toll. In total, Gilead's hep C sales fell to $4 billion in the second quarter from last year s $4.9 billion,  primarily due to a decline in sales  for the company s superstar hep C combo Harvoni, according to the earnings release.

Unsurprisingly, one of the company's goals is moving beyond its staple antivirals--HIV in addition to hepatitis C--into other fields. Milligan said he's  very interested  in adding to Gilead's pipeline in the ""non-antiviral area,"" and he hopes to end 2016 ""with a more complete story of internal and external programs.""

One bright spot in the earnings report came from Gilead's antiviral business outside of hep C: The company grew HIV and  other  antiviral sales to $3.1 billion versus last year s $2.7 billion thanks to Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey sales increases.

During the quarter, Gilead earned FDA approval for the first all-genotype hep C med, Epclusa, that it priced at a discount to its predecessors. Epclusa s list price is $74,760 for a 12-week regimen, according to reports, less than Sovaldi or Harvoni, which ring in at $84,000 and $94,500 before discounts.

On Monday, the New Jersey pharma announced its rVSV-ZEBOV has won the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the EMA s Priority Medicines status.

With both designations, the vaccine is set to receive additional regulatory support in its push toward licensure thanks to promising clinical data and a potential to best current Ebola options. Merck plans to submit the vaccine for approval by the end of 2017 as part of a partnership with Gavi that will see the Vaccine Alliance pay $5 million to build a stockpile.

The milestones also come following concerns aired by experts who warned that complacency could lead Ebola vaccine developers to walk away from unfinished projects as the vaccine research community turned to Zika earlier this year. With the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa waning in 2015, pharmaceutical companies with promising candidates saw their trial options narrow even as some U.S. federal funding for Ebola was redirected to Zika.

In April, the events led Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar to declare that,  the job is still not done.  He stressed that complacency could lead to  Ebola vaccine development that is left half-finished. 

Merck is pushing ahead. In a statement, Paula Annuziato, VP for clinical research at Merck Research Laboratories, said the milestones allow the company to  continue to accelerate development   of the vaccine,  potentially meeting this public health need. 

Aside from Merck, Big Pharma peers GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) and Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) also advanced Ebola candidates into Phase III. Novavax, Profectus Biosciences and Inovio have candidates as well. Merck licensed its candidate from NewLink Genetics.

Roll out a superior product at the same price--and that s what Shire believes it s doing with newly approved dry eye med Xiidra.

The Dublin-based drugmaker has decided to roll out its new product--green-lighted by the FDA earlier this month--at about $5,000 per year, according to Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat. A 30-day supply will cost $426.73--which just so happens to be the exact same price of a 30-day supply of rival Allergan product Restasis.

With the move, Shire forgoes an opportunity to slap a premium price on its med. Some industry watchers had expected as much; after all, Xiidra is the first med indicated specifically for dry eye, with blockbuster Restasis technically meant for  tear production. 

But doing so could have had consequences. Though the label is  clearly better  for Xiidra, a  meaningful premium  may have spurred some maneuvering from payers to make Restasis the go-to med, Raffat wrote to clients shortly after Shire s regulatory win.

Now, it ll be up to Shire s sales and marketing teams to talk up Xiidra s advantages and lure patients away from Restasis. But as Allergan commercial chief Bill Meury has said, Shire might not have an easy time doing so.

For one, Restasis boasts a payer coverage rate of about 85%, he pointed out on February s Q4 conference call. And for two, some 70% of Restasis patients are repeat users, suggesting their loyalties lie with Allergan.

Even with the introduction of Xiidra,  I just don't see any major disruption,  he told investors.

Analysts don t necessarily disagree. As Raffat figures, even if Xiidra does grab some Restasis volume--say, 30% over time, he estimates--Allergan may be able to offset about 10% to 15% of that through a series of price increases. And Bernstein s Ronny Gal wrote to clients earlier this month that Allergan s  power of incumbency  will make for what will likely be a  stable oligopoly  between the two meds.

But those hopes were dashed when a data monitoring committee advised the German drugmaker to halt a clinical trial.

The German drugmaker stopped two Phase III trials evaluating the med in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who showed no signs of disease after chemo. The company had hoped to show that post-chemo Gilotrif treatment would help keep the cancer from returning, but an independent data monitoring committee thought otherwise.

The committee  made the assessment that it would be highly unlikely  that Boehringer s trials would produce a significant advantage for the company s product over placebo, Boehringer said Monday.

While Boehringer s expansion effort may have been thwarted, it has others in the works. As the company noted, it s still developing the med in other solid tumors--an effort it hopes will boost Gilotrif, which boasts approvals in distinct types of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

And Gilotrif could use that boost. It last year picked up a new EGFR competitor in AstraZeneca s Iressa, which staged a comeback with a first-line lung cancer nod after four years off the market. And it was already up against Tarceva, a therapy from cancer giant Roche.

Meanwhile, though, Boehringer is focusing its efforts on areas other than cancer, too. It recently agreed to trade away its consumer health assets to Sanofi in exchange for the French drugmaker s animal health unit. And it s been making waves in diabetes with partner Eli Lilly; last year, the pair s Jardiance became the first diabetes med to show it could cut the combined rate of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death, and the tandem now plans to test the drug as a treatment for heart failure.

But it's gifts to politicians--one, in particular--that have been in the spotlight since presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her VP pick Friday.

In 2006, Barr Pharmaceutical, now a part of Teva ($TEVA), flew Clinton running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)--then the governor of Virginia--to a meeting in Aspen, CO, on a private jet, state records seen by The New York Times show. That flight was worth $12,000, according to Kaine s disclosure report, and it came at a time when Barr execs were lobbying Kaine to pen a letter to the FDA on its behalf.

Kaine signed a letter to U.S. regulators--as requested by Barr--before taking the flight, the NYT notes. And as email correspondence from a governor s aide shows, a company lobbyist was prepared to follow up with Kaine during the flight.

Lobbyist Phil Smith  will likely speak with Gov about him sending a letter in support of the petition in Aspen this weekend, hence this email to ya ll,  aide Eileen Filler-Corn wrote in an August 2006 email.

The flight and other gifts Kaine pocketed during his governor stint were legal under Virginia s laws at the time because they were disclosed, the Times points out. And as Kaine spokeswoman Amy Dudley told the paper,  many governors at the time believed, as then-Governor Kaine did, that more widespread use of generic drugs would reduce state and federal health care costs without compromising the quality of care. 

But critics have raised red flags over the gift s timing.  It would be na ve to think a pharmaceutical company like Teva was not interested in maintaining access to the governor as a result of a gift of that size,  Andrew Miller, a lobbyist and former Democratic attorney general in Virginia, told the NYT.

The issue has already triggered backlash from Clinton opponent Donald Trump, who dubbed the former governor  Corrupt Kaine  on Friday night.

Meanwhile, Teva recently made big strides in getting its voice heard in Washington. Last week, industry trade group PhRMA welcomed the Israeli generics giant into its ranks--despite complaints from peers such as AbbVie ($ABBV), who argued that the presence of a generics powerhouse on the group s roster would lead to disputes with brand-only drugmakers.

Now, it s nabbed a $13 million cash infusion in a Series A financing to advance that and other work.

The round was co-led by Takeda Ventures and Dr. David Pyott, who was previously chairman and CEO of Allergan. Cota Capital and Joe Kiani, the chairman and CEO of patient monitoring company Masimo ($MASI), also participated.

""Bioniz is an exciting, emerging biotechnology company with a truly novel approach to addressing autoimmune diseases and cancer,  said Pyott in a statement.  I look forward to working with the company and its leadership, and together, realize our vision to create the next generation of selective immune therapies."" He was CEO of Allergan from 1998 through 2015.

The Irvine, CA-based startup aims to discover and develop first-in-class peptide therapeutics that inhibit multiple cytokines, both selectively and simultaneously. Its lead programs are BNZ-1 and BNZ-2.

The idea is to selectively inhibit functionally redundant cytokines while leaving the rest of the cytokine network untouched to treat immuno-inflammatory diseases and cancer.

BNZ-1, a selective inhibitor of cytokines IL2/IL9/IL15 that is slated to treat HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and for certain T-cell leukemias, is lined up for the clinical trial with NIH. BNZ-2 is a preclinical selective inhibitor of cytokines IL15/IL21 that s intended to treat celiac disease and other immuno-inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

""The acceptance of the BNZ-1 IND is a great accomplishment by our team and we are excited to collaborate with the NIH on the clinical advancement of this program,"" said Bioniz founder, President and CEO Dr. Nazli Azimi.

As part of the financing, Ilan Zipkin, senior investment director of Takeda Ventures, and Masimo s Kiani have joined the company s board.

It first entered the field via a 2014 deal with Spark Therapeutics in hemophilia; at that time, the pharma also established a dedicated gene therapy research center in London known as the Genetic Medicines Institute that s part of its Rare Disease Research Unit.

In the Bamboo buy, Pfizer had already purchased about 22% of the company during the first quarter for about $43 million. It has now purchased the remaining company for an upfront of $150 million. Bamboo investors stand to receive up to an additional $495 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones.

With this deal, Pfizer adds advanced recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based gene therapies that it expects will complement its existing rare disease and gene therapy portfolios.

These include a preclinical neuromuscular candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare disease that has seen a number of recent clinical disappointments, as well as preclinical candidates to treat Friedreich s ataxia and Canavan disease and a Phase I candidate for giant axonal neuropathy.

 The field of gene therapy research has made tremendous strides in recent years, and we are pleased to be able to further enhance our leadership position in this area through this transaction with Bamboo,  said Pfizer President of Worldwide R&D Dr. Mikael Dolsten in a statement.

Pfizer isn t done yet on the gene therapy dealmaking front. Continued Dolsten,  We believe that gene therapy may hold the promise of bringing true disease modification for patients suffering from devastating diseases, and we hope to see this promise come to fruition--through new and existing in-house capabilities and potential partnership opportunities--in the years to come. 

In addition to the Bamboo pipeline, Pfizer gains an operating gene therapy manufacturing facility that Bamboo bought from the University of North Carolina earlier this year. It s producing candidates for use in Phase I/II testing.

The pharma also has several academic research agreements, including one with King s College London to develop a series of rAAV gene therapy vectors and another with the University of Iowa Research Foundation to develop a potential gene therapy for cystic fibrosis.

Pfizer has also partnered with Emeryville, CA-based Molecular Therapeutics (4DMT) to discover and develop targeted next-generation rAAV vectors for cardiac disease; it made an investment in the company last fall.

The trial was unblinded early at an interim endpoint due to significant improvement in motor milestones in treated versus untreated infants. The drug is expected to become a blockbuster, exceeding $1 billion in annual sales--good news for both of the recently beleaguered companies.

It has paid Ionis a $75 million fee to exercise its option to develop and market nusinersen globally; it expects to start regulatory filings for nusinersen  in the coming months.  There is currently no approved treatment of SMA which results in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness, with the most severe type resulting in paralysis and death.

Nusinersen met the primary endpoint of significant improvement in achievement of motor milestones as compared to untreated patients in the ENDEAR study, but further data details are as yet undisclosed. The study has been stopped and all patients in this trial as well as in the sham-controlled arm of another study, EMBRACE, will transition to nusinersen; data from the other ENDEAR endpoints will be analyzed at a later point when the full data set is available.

 Infants treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in the achievement of motor milestones has measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, compared to those who did not receive version,  said Ionis chairman and CEO Stanley Crooke on a conference call about the data.

 The responder analysis conducted looked at achievement of tangible milestones like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and in some cases even walking. So, it provides a real demonstration of the value that nusinersen may be bringing to these patients and their families in their everyday lives. Nusinersen also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the trial,  he added.

The full data from this trial, known as ENDEAR, hadn t been anticipated until the first half of next year. It s a 13 month, 122-patient study in infantile-onset SMA.

There are about 15,000 SMA patients in the U.S. Wall Street is modeling a consensus expectation of peak annual sales of $1.7 billion by 2025 for nusinersen, which assumes about a 45% penetration with a one year mediation duration of therapy and a $250,000 price, according to Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum.

Biogen partnered with Ionis in SMA in 2012--prior to the latter s subsequent name change from Isis Pharmaceuticals. If nusinersen is approved globally, Ionis will gain $150 million in milestones. Biogen is assuming clinical trial costs going forward and will lead global commercialization, with Ionis getting a tiered royalty of up to a mid-teens percentage of sales.

Summed up Scangos on the next clinical steps for nusinersen,  Ionis and Biogen will continue to work to identify the quickest path forward to collect the necessary data from CHERISH, a Phase III study investigating nusinersen inpatients with childhood-onset SMA and with NURTURE a Phase II study in pre-symptomatic infants - so the regulators can evaluate the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in these populations. 

Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to alter the splicing of SMN2; it s intended to increase production of fully functional SMN protein.

Both Biogen and Ionis have been troubled of late. The former is losing its head, George Scangos, who turned around the company years ago with its multiple sclerosis franchise, but it has since been stymied more recently by slowing sales of its Tecfidera.

For its part, Ionis tanked in May after partner GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) opted not to continue after a clinical trial hold for IONIS-TTRRx in an ongoing Phase III study, NEURO-TTR, in patients with transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloid polyneuropathy. At that time, there was some concern that the safety issues, which included severe declines in platelets, that had also been an issue for Ionis  volanesorsen could extend across the entire platform of the company.

Biogen chose the earliest potential time to opt-in on this deal, making this a strong testament of its faith in the program going forward. In early trading on the news, Biogen tipped up about 5% while Ionis shares leapt up by almost 30%

The Irish biopharma has been given the track designation from the U.S. regulator for SHP626 (also known as volixibat) for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis. This condition, which is estimated to affect millions of Americans, is directly related to the rise of obesity and type II diabetes, and can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer and death.

 Shire s development plan for SHP626 is designed to address the unmet need in the treatment of adult patients who have NASH with liver fibrosis,  said Philip Vickers, head of R&D, Shire.

 This fast track designation is further recognition of the critical need to develop new, effective therapeutic options for patients with this serious condition. 

There are currently no approved meds in this area, but analysts believe--as with the hep C drugs from Gilead ($GILD)--a highly efficacious treatment that could cure patients of the condition could be a major blockbuster contender, with predictions being as high as $10 billion at peak per med.

Shire is racing Gilead, Intercept Pharmaceuticals ($ICPT), Genfit and others in what could eventually be a $40 billion market, although most of its rivals are further up the path than the biopharma in development terms.

Intercept appears to be the nearest to market after gaining in May an FDA approval for Ocaliva in a separate liver disease license known as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)--in what is being seen as a precursor to a NASH license. The biotech has however come up against problems as last year it flubbed a Phase II NASH test, but it has shown promise in other trials.

A year ago, Intercept began enrollment in a new global study for its NASH candidate designed to show if it can reduce liver scarring and prevent death and end-stage liver disease.

Final data won't be ready until 2021, but Intercept has scheduled an interim analysis in 2017 that will evaluate how well its drug is doing at resolving NASH and reducing scars in about 1,400 patients. It has said it plans to submit those results to the FDA for a shot at early approval.

Meanwhile Genfit, likely a second-place contender, has told FierceBiotech that it expects its drug to be approved by the FDA in 2019. Shire and Gilead are a little further down the ladder.

Shire s candidate is a once daily pill that works as an inhibitor of the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter--a protein which is primarily responsible for recycling bile acids from the intestine to the liver.

It s been in Phase I but is now set to move into midstage, placebo-controlled studies. The drug was originally licensed from Lumena Pharmaceuticals.

In total, Tokai will cull its workforce by around 60% to a total of 10  full-time equivalent employees,  according to its statement, with this bloodletting expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter.

The Boston, MA-based company posted data last week showing that its experimental cancer med galeterone was likely not to best Astellas/Medivation s ($MDVN) Xtandi (enzalutamide) in a Phase III trial.

On the recommendation of its data monitoring committee, which said it would be a flop, the biotech discontinued that pivotal trial due to disappointing data. Tokai shares tumbled by about 70% on the news last week.

The company had other studies lined up, including its ARMOR2 expansion in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) for patients with acquired resistance to Xtandi, and also a planned test in patients who rapidly progress on either Xtandi or Janssen s ($JNJ) prostate cancer drug Zytiga (abiraterone acetate). The future of these trials is, however, uncertain.

In a brief statement, the biotech said:  This workforce reduction is designed to reduce operating expenses while the company conducts a comprehensive evaluation of strategic options for galeterone and its pipeline. Affected employees are being offered severance and outplacement assistance. 

The biotech hopes to save $4.2 million as a result of the cuts, although it will absorb a third-quarter charge of $1.3 million in severance costs for its former staffers.

 A reduction in force is a very difficult yet necessary step in light of the recent discontinuation of the ARMOR3-SV trial of galeterone in mCRPC,  said Jodie Morrison, president and CEO of Tokai.

 I would like to personally express my appreciation to each of the employees impacted by this decision for their commitment to the development of galeterone, as well as for their meaningful contributions to a program that has expanded the dialogue among the medical and patient communities about AR-V7 and advanced prostate cancer treatment options.

The advance of the asset, which comes one year after Pfizer Venture Investments and others bankrolled Autifony s expansion into schizophrenia, is underpinned by safety data from a 60-person Phase I trial.

London, U.K.-based Autifony spun out of GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) in 2011 to develop an age-related hearing loss program, before branching out into schizophrenia in response to evidence that Kv3 voltage-gated potassium channels play a role in the disease. Pfizer s ($PFE) VC wing, SV Life Sciences and other investors handed Autifony  8 million ($10.5 million) to explore this idea last year, giving the company the financial means to push AUT00206 through the Phase I trial.

The single-site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study featured two parts. In the first stage, participants, who were either fasting or fed, received up to 5 single doses of AUT00206 or a placebo. The second stage was a multiple ascending dose study.

Autifony has exited the Phase I trial with data it thinks show AUT00206 is safe, well tolerated and has pharmacokinetics capable of supporting clinically effective concentrations of the drug. Armed with the data, Autifony is pushing ahead with a pair of Phase Ib trials designed to give it a clearer picture of whether the effects it has seen in preclinical translate into the clinic.

One of the studies will be overseen by Bill Deakin, a professor at the University of Manchester who has spent more than a decade researching schizophrenia. Autifony has described the trial as a  ketamine challenge study.  In challenge studies, researchers induce diseaselike states in subjects. Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) is among the companies that have used ketamine for this purpose. The Big Pharma gave low doses of the party drug to induce psychotic symptoms in healthy volunteers, enabling it to gauge the effectiveness of its candidate JNJ-40411813.

The second Phase Ib planned by Autifony will enroll patients with schizophrenia. Autifony is looking to this trial to generate data on clinical biomarkers of efficacy.

The belief that AUT00206 can have an effect on patients with schizophrenia is underpinned by knowledge of the role Kv3 channels play in the control of parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These interneurons are thought to malfunction in schizophrenia, leading to suggestions that modulation of the Kv3 channels could improve outcomes in patients.

Autifony is exploring this idea in parallel to its work on hearing disorders. Both aspects of the pipeline are built upon understanding of Kv3 channels, which, as well as being linked to schizophrenia, are involved in the neural circuits that handle the processing of sound. AUT00063, Autifony s lead drug, is currently being tested as a way to improve speech recognition in users of cochlear implants.

The French Big Pharma and the U.S. biotech said the European Medicines Agency has today accepted for review their marketing app for sarilumab--an IL-6 inhibitor mAb that wants a blockbuster license for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The drug is already on the FDA s books, with the U.S. regulator set to make a decision on whether to approve the med by the end of October.

Things are looking good for the pair--which have been ramping up the R&D deals between them over the past two years--as sarilumab recently bested AbbVie's ($ABBV) top-selling autoimmune TNF blocker Humira (adalimumab) in a Phase III head-to-head study in RA.

The treatment has been touted as a blockbuster in waiting, with 2020 sales predicted to hit $1.8 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by EvaluatePharma.

Humira, the biggest-selling med in the world, made around $14 billion last year and has a host of licenses including rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and others.

The drug is, however, set to see its sales hit in the coming years with a slew of cheaper biosimilars waiting in the wings to usurp its top-selling drug spot.

Sarilumab would become the second approved product to come out of from Sanofi's wide-ranging partnership with Regeneron, following on from its launch of Praluent (alirocumab), an antibody designed to clear out bad cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9.

In a Phase II trial, the oral microbiome therapeutic SER-109 failed to outperform a placebo in terms of cutting the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), leaving the biotech scraping through the results in search a path forward for the program.

The Phase II study enrolled 89 subjects and randomized them to receive either SER-109 or a placebo. Once the subjects completed antibiotic treatment for CDI, two-thirds of them received a single oral dose of the bacterial spores that make up SER-109, with the remaining one-third getting a placebo. Seres had hoped SER-109 would recalibrate participants  microbiomes, resulting in fewer subjects in the treatment arm experiencing recurrences of CDI.

Unfortunately for Seres, the 8-week data tell a different story. In the SER-109 arm of the study, 44% of participants experience a recurrence of CDI. A little more than half of subjects who received the placebo saw their CDI recur. When Seres crunched the numbers, this difference fell short of being a statistically significant reduction in relative risk of CDI recurrence, leaving the firm with a Phase II trial that failed to meet its primary endpoint. Among subjects aged under 65 years old, the placebo bested SER-109.

Seres was blindsided by multiple aspects of the data.  The recurrence rates observed in the overall SER-109 treatment group, in the age-stratified subgroups and in the placebo groups are inconsistent with our expectations,  CEO Roger Pomerantz said in a statement.

The next step for Seres is to compare the Phase II data to results generated in an earlier investigator sponsored Phase Ib trial. Once Seres has a handle on the situation, it plans to talk with FDA--which awarded SER-109 breakthrough status last year--and revise its development strategy as required.

Shares in Seres were down more than 70% in premarket trading.

The fallout from the setback could extend well beyond Seres, which has been held up as an example of the potential of the microbiome sector, both from a financial and therapeutic perspective. In the good times, such as after Seres pulled off a $134 million IPO, the company has delivered a sector-wide boost to the nascent field.

Speaking to FierceBiotech late last year, Isabelle de Cremoux, the CEO of Seventure Partners and its Novartis ($NVS)-backed microbiome fund, identified the Seres IPO as a tipping point for the sector.

 After Seres  IPO, the VC community started to wake up and say,  oh, maybe there s something in the microbiome field that we better watch,   she said.

Now, the sector is facing its first major clinical-phase blowup. Once again, the microbiome field and those who invest in it are watching Seres closely.

From this new, potentially-less-adversarial negotiating position, Sanofi says it is ready to move quickly to get a deal done.

As it stands, Sanofi is one of multiple suitors that have entered into confidentiality agreements with Medivation. Pfizer ($PFE) and Celgene ($CELG) are reported to be among the other drugmakers kicking the tires ahead of a potential bid for Medivation, but, to date, Sanofi has been the most vocal about its desire to snag the biotech and its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi.

In pursuing its prey, Sanofi has riled Medivation on occasion--the biotech hit out against  misleading claims  and  coercive efforts  last month--but the French Big Pharma now thinks any bad blood can be forgotten, creating an environment in which the companies can hammer out terms.

 We have entered this new phase of our discussion with Medivation, which of course we expect will be much more productive,  Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said on a conference call attended by Bloomberg.

How this expected shift in the tone of negotiations affects Sanofi s ability to get a deal done remains to be seen, but Brandicourt is preparing for the endgame.  There is no certainty in terms of timing but we are ready clearly to move quickly,  he said.

Brandicourt was speaking following the release of second-quarter results that reiterated why he is keen to mark the start of his time in charge of Sanofi with a sizable acquisition. Sanofi s results once again highlighted the divide in the business, which resembles a fast-growing biotech burdened with a lumbering, underperforming pharma unit. Sales at Sanofi Genzyme were up 20%, but even this was insufficient to offset the ongoing difficulties of its diabetes business. In Paris, Sanofi shares fell 2%.

Buying Medivation would give Sanofi another blockbuster drug in Xtandi, plus a pipeline of products that could drive growth in the years to come. The value of Medivation s pipeline is one of the sticking points in the negotiations. Medivation CEO David Hung has argued that talazoparib, a Phase III poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, is positioned to be a big blockbuster worth far more than the $3-per-share CVR proposed by Sanofi.

The ability of Sanofi, or one of Medivation s other suitors, to find a deal structure that closes the gap in perceptions of talazoparib s value will go a long way to dictating whether the takeout happens. For its part, Sanofi is maintaining that, despite its hunger for a deal, it will walk away if Medivation pushes back too hard.

 I emphasize that we will remain financially disciplined throughout this process,  Brandicourt said, according to Reuters.

The scheme, which to date has accepted 8 drugs while rejecting almost 30, is designed to ensure developers of products with the potential to address major unmet needs receive support with regulatory applications and potentially accelerated reviews.

EMA has awarded PRIME status to Adaptimmune s NY-ESO-targeting T-cell therapy as a treatment for certain patients with inoperable or metastatic synovial sarcoma, a rare soft tissue cancer. The PRIME status is limited to the use of the T-cell therapy in HLA-A0201, HLA-A0205 or HLA-A0206 allele positive patients who have been through chemotherapy and have tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 antigen.

As Adaptimmune advances its candidate through development in this indication, it will receive extra support from European regulators. EMA has committed to engaging in early discussions with firms on its PRIME program, a strategy it thinks will improve trial designs. Adaptimmune will also benefit from a dedicated point of contact at EMA, guidance on its regulatory strategy, scientific advice throughout development and, depending on the merits of its application, potentially accelerated assessment.

EMA has shown a willingness to limit these benefits to the candidates it views as most deserving. The PRIME nod for Adaptimmune brought the total number of assets accepted into the program up to eight, half of which are in oncology indications. To put that figure into context, EMA has rejected 27 requests to join PRIME and dismissed two before even starting to formally review the submissions. Of the nine requests EMA processed at the same time as Adaptimmune, the regulator rejected seven.

The other successful applicant was Texas-based DNAtrix, which snagged a spot on the program for its treatment for recurrent glioblastoma. In the two previous months in which PRIME has been active, EMA accepted requests for Novartis  ($NVS) leukemia drug CTL019, Merck s ($MRK) Ebola vaccine and Biogen s ($BIIB) Alzheimer s disease hopeful aducanumab.

The deal gives Pfizer a chance to pick up the oncolytic vaccinia virus once it has completed Phase I, something the Big Pharma will work to achieve with its new partner.

WO-12 is currently in preclinical testing, but Pfizer has already seen enough in the data to envisage a place for the asset in its immuno-oncology portfolio. The virus, which has shown potential against kidney cancer in mice, is designed to replicate in cancer cells while delivering genes that support the immune response against the tumor. Western Oncolytics thinks the virus could hit multiple types of solid tumors and, importantly for Pfizer, play a role in combination treatments.

To achieve this profile, Western Oncolytics has taken a vaccinia virus, armed it with TRIF and HPGD genes and stripped its surface of anything that could cause the immune system to recognize it as an intruder. Once delivered intravenously or intratumorally, the virus should pass unmolested around the body. Upon entering a healthy cell, a gene modification in the virus is supposed to take effect, limiting the extent to which it replicates.

This safety switch lies dormant when the virus is in a cancer cell. When exposed to the chemistry found in cancer cells, Western Oncolytics expects WO-12 will replicate, resulting in virus numbers increasing until they destroy their host. The newly released viruses then infect neighboring cancer cells, continuing the process.

In concert, the presence of TRIF is intended to stimulate cytotoxic T cells. The inclusion of HPGD is expected to support the actions of the T cells by taking out immunosuppressors.

If the virus works in practice as in theory, these multiple mechanisms will shrink the tumor. And the presence of lysed material will support an adaptive immune response, equipping the body to identify and eliminate cancer cells.

The final step in the process is the removal of the engineered viruses. While the WO-12 virus has a deglycosylated surface, the viruses made in the body lack this defense. As such, the immune system should remove them over time, limiting the risk of side effects.

Cleveland, OH-based Western Oncolytics has worked on this idea since setting up shop in 2012. Last year it raised $2.5 million in a Series A, bringing its fundraising haul up to $2.8 million. By the standards of immuno-oncology startups, the numbers and r sum s of those involved are relatively modest. CEO Kurt Rote headed up product development and marketing at BiognoSYS prior to founding Western Oncolytics. The University of Pittsburgh s Stephen Thorne invented the technology.

Now, this team has attracted the attention of Pfizer, resulting in a deal that could see the Big Pharma buy their lead candidate.

In addition, IPOs are leaning more than ever on existing investors buying shares in the IPO. The average portion going to insider buying is 40% for 2016 biotech IPOs; that's double the roughly 20%-per-deal average for each of the last two years.

The latest example of an underwhelming biotech IPO, of course, is scandal-tainted Kadmon ($KDMN), which priced this week at $12 but is already down by almost 20%, languishing in the single digits. Kadmon insiders had to commit to buying more than half of that IPO. NantHealth, which also has its own hint of scandal with an ongoing lawsuit by former senior employees that alleges fraud, has fallen by 25% since its June IPO.

Biotech is entirely alone, not joined by its technology peers, in its languishing IPO prices. For nonbiotech IPOs, a whopping 29 out of 30 that have priced this year remain above their offer price, by an average of 28%.

The biotech IPOs from the first quarter managed to fare much better than those since then or in the year before. Of those 7 IPOs, 5 are still trading above the offer price with an average increase of 28%, exactly on par with the nonbiotech performance thus far this year.

August won t be much better. The dog days of summer don t typically see many, if any, biotech IPOs. Right now, no biotech companies are on the road for an IPO, unless you count Gemphire Therapeutics, which has been trying to get a $45 million IPO out the door for a few weeks now.

Also, AIM-listed Motif BIO ($MTFB) does plan to conduct its first Nasdaq offering this summer to back its pipeline of antibiotics targeting drug-resistant bacteria to raise $35 million.

But going into the fall, investors are surely looking for more promising, higher quality IPOs. And VCs will be under pressure to deliver, given the rampant underperformance of biotech IPOs for most of this year and all of last.

Among them, it reaffirmed its commitment to CAR-T approaches from partners Juno Therapeutics ($JUNO) and bluebird bio ($BLUE), as well as noted immuno-oncology deals with Jounce Therapeutics and AstraZeneca ($AZN).

Juno was hit earlier this month with an FDA trial hold after at least three deaths in its CAR-T trials for JCAR015, but the hold was quickly lifted as the agency agreed with the company s assessment that it would be sufficient to alter the pretreatment regimen to exclude chemotherapy fludarabine.

In April, Celgene opted into a CD19 program partnership that includes JCAR015 as well as additional CD19-directed candidates JCAR017 and JCAR014. Under the deal, Celgene gained commercial rights outside of North America and China, with Juno retaining rights there.

Despite its rapid resolution, the recent Juno clinical trial hold at least raised the question of potential further difficulties in treatment combinations that include CAR-T candidates.

But Celgene was unfazed by the recent issue, specifically citing two CAR-T programs as key drivers of long-term growth: its CD19 program with Juno and its B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) program with bluebird bio.

 In April, we opened into the program with Juno and make good progress with their respective development programs for Europe,  noted Celgene President of Hematology & Oncology Michael Pehl on a July 28 earnings call.

As for bluebird, its CAR-T deal with Celgene dates back to 2013, but was specifically focused on candidates targeting BCMA last summer under a three-year updated deal.

Celgene also highlighted other immuno-oncology deals, including its brand-new one with Jounce Therapeutics and its AstraZeneca ($AZN) collaboration for an anti-PD-L1 inhibitor that dates back to last spring.

 Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Jounce Therapeutics adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immune therapies,  said Celgene CEO Mark Alles on the earnings call. ""Our work with Jounce is expected to add to the progress we are making with our oncology partner AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways expected have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders.

The Italian institute (also known as SR-TIGET)--which is the result of joint collab between Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele--will work with Cambridge, MA-based CRISPR biotech Editas to research and develop genome edited hematopoietic stem cell and T-cell therapies.

The institute already works with GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) to develop its recently approved (in Europe) stem cell therapy Strimvelis for the incredibly rare condition known colloquially as  bubble boy syndrome.  Last January, SR-TIGET also signed a collab with Big Biotech Biogen ($BIIB) to jointly develop gene therapies for the treatment of both hemophilia A and B.

The scientific work at SR-TIGET in Milan, Italy, will be led by institute director Dr. Luigi Naldini, a world-renowned expert in lentiviral gene therapy and hematology. Lentiviral vectors are engineered viruses used to deliver working versions of defective genes responsible for causing certain diseases into the patients  cells.

Stated goals of the tie-up--financial details of which were not revealed--include the development of gene correction strategies for the treatment of rare diseases, with two specified indications in the blood and bone marrow. Further details were not shared.

 Dr. Naldini and SR-TIGET are world leaders in gene therapy,  said Katrine Bosley, CEO at Editas Medicine. ""They have pioneered many important scientific advancements working with cells of the immune system and have extensive expertise in translating that work into cell-based therapies. We believe there will be great synergy across our scientific teams through this collaboration. 

Editas pulled off a $94.4 million IPO earlier this year, coming despite strong headwinds in the market that blew so many other biotechs off course. Its primary focus has been on the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9 and is slated to begin human trials of its tech next year.

It has however fallen behind the University of Pennsylvania in being the first to trial CRISPR in the clinic, as it gained the NIH go-ahead for a study last month, with the FDA now to make the final decision on whether it can start this year.

Chinese researchers however last week announced they will likely pip Penn s academics to the post, as they have been given the green light as well--but could start as soon as next month.

Editas is currently working on a number of projects, including a Duchenne muscular dystrophy program, as well as on researching hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).

In its latest HSPC data, released in May, the biotech showed long-term engraftment in vivo after Cas9-mediated genome editing. These data also showed that editing did not alter hematopoietic reconstitution or differentiation properties in comparison to untreated control HSPCs.

 My team and I believe genome editing is a promising answer to advance medicines to treat technically challenging diseases,  added Dr. Naldini.  We at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy have worked for years to develop targeted integration of therapeutic genes into T cells and HSCs, and the collaboration with Editas Medicine represents an important opportunity to develop more effective and safe therapies for patients in the years ahead. 

Editas' shares ended more than 4% up at close yesterday (before the institute deal was announced).

The U.S. regulator put the trial of the drug on hold over safety concerns, coming after a second case of jaundice emerged in a Phase I trial after the patient received a single dose of RG-101. The drug is being developed with Regulus  partner GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK).

It was given an oral notice from the FDA exactly a month ago, but today said it had been given a detailed sheet of tasks to do before the regulator can lift the hold.

These include detailed safety data analysis from preclinical and clinical studies; exploration of potential mechanisms of hepatoxicity in nonclinical models; review and input from independent hepatotoxicity experts; additional PK data from the U.S. Phase I study; and a risk/benefit assessment for the proposed therapeutic regimens containing RG-101.

Although a long list, this is essentially a data-gathering exercise, and does not include the need to conduct any further trials. Regulus was upbeat about the task ahead, saying it  anticipates submitting the necessary information by early Q4 2016. 

A month after these new data have been submitted, the FDA should let the biotech know whether it will lift the hold, or requires more info. The drug is currently undergoing Phase I/II trials.

""We are working expeditiously to resolve the issues outlined in the letter and anticipate a decision from the FDA in the fourth quarter,"" said Paul Grint, president and CEO of Regulus.

""Timelines of on-going studies have not been impacted by the clinical hold, and we remain on track to deliver follow-up results from ongoing RG-101 studies at upcoming relevant scientific meetings later this year.""

RG-101 works as a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-122 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. It is however looking to get into a crowded space, with Gilead s ($GILD) megablockbusters Sovaldi and Harvoni dominating the market for the past three years with their impressive cure rates, with new therapies from Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY), Merck ($MRK) and AbbVie ($ABBV) all vying for space.

Regulus is also working on RG-012, an anti-miR targeting microRNA-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome--a life-threatening kidney disease driven by genetic mutations with no approved therapy.

The California biotech finished the day up by more than 16%, but traded down after hours by nearly 2% after the company posted the update at 16:10 ET. The biotech as of yesterday had a market cap of just $220 million.

First up, the company has ditched a Phase III combo trial of Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids), which is licensed to help lower triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and its SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes med Farxiga (dapagliflozin) that was seeking to treat the liver disease NASH, which has a number of biopharmas chasing what could be a $40 billion market.

It will also not continue the late-stage GOLD study of its marketed ovarian cancer drug and PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib) in second-line gastric cancer. The writing had been on the wall as in May, Astra announced that the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival when used with chemo, compared to chemo alone.

It had originally said it would be assessing these data, but has now clearly decided to cut its losses in this patient population.

And it doesn t stop there. In its Q2 Astra also scrapped a number of NMEs from Phase I, all of which come from the locker of its MedImmune unit.

This included its experimental compound MEDI0639, a DLL-4 mAb for solid tumors. DLL4 plays an big role in vascular development and is widely expressed on the vasculature of normal and tumor tissues.

It also dropped a combo trial for its PD-L1 drug durvalumab (which recently gained an FDA ""breakthrough"" in bladder cancer) and MEDI6383, an OX40 agonist, also targeting solid tumors.

The OX40 agonist has shown antitumor efficacy in preclinical trials and is believed to have the ability to combine effectively with therapeutic cancer vaccines, as well as immuno-oncology targets. A Phase I for MEDI6383 on its own has also been culled.

And finally MEDI7836, an IL-13 mAb YTE asthma candidate, will also not be progressed. AstraZeneca has in Phase III an alpha-chain of the interleukin-5 receptor mAb for asthma in the form of benralizumab, although this did not come from MedImmune.

AstraZeneca gave little detail away in its release, listing simply those trials removed from its pipeline. But seeing as it bought MedImmune for more than $15 billion nearly a decade ago to bolster its early-stage pipeline, this clearing out of the early-stage closet can only be a painful experience.

In a statement to FierceBiotech, MedImmune said:  MedImmune s innovative and sustainable pipeline is arguably one of the best in the industry. Biologics represent 50 percent of the overall AstraZeneca pipeline, with more than 120 biologics currently in development, including more than 40 in clinical development.

 As we ve previously communicated, and as is typical in an early development program, we had three investigational OX40 assets in pre-clinical development, acknowledging that our strategy would be to bring one forward into clinical development, including:

 Each asset displayed slightly different biology, both in vitro and in vivo and we evaluated the unique characteristics of each molecule to better understand how they might provide the optimal response, both as monotherapy and in combination, in patients with cancer. Based on extensive research, we made the decision to move forward with MEDI5062, the humanized monoclonal antibody, and are very pleased with this molecule based on initial progression.  This is reflected in our updated clinical pipeline table.

 We are now focused on developing a comprehensive clinical trial program for MEDI0562 that includes two Ph1 studies as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab or tremelimumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity in adults with selected advanced solid tumours.

 Again, MEDI5062 remains an important asset in our broad immuno-oncology portfolio, and a promising component of our robust pipeline.

ALK-Abello, which is based a short drive from Genmab, had a less rosy week. Following sluggish sales, Merck decided to hand back rights to ALK s sublingual allergy immunotherapies, leaving the Danish drugmaker without a North American partner at a time when one of the assets is nearing a regulatory approval decision date.

1. J&J, Genmab bag breakthrough status for Darzalex, shortening route to second-line use

FDA staffers have joined the long list of people to be impressed by data on Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) and Genmab s (CPH:GEN) cancer drug Darzalex. The regulator recently took a look at data from trials that gave Darzalex in combination with Celgene s ($CELG) Revlimid and Takeda s Velcade, after which it granted breakthrough therapy status to the drug as a second-line treatment for multiple myeloma.

Merck ($MRK) has shocked ALK-Abello (CPH:ALK-B) and its investors by returning the rights to three sublingual allergy immunotherapy tablets. The decision, which comes partway through a clinical trial and regulatory approval process, leaves ALK without a partner in the U.S. and triggered an 18% drop in its share price.

3. UniQure yo-yos as data raise questions about its place in hem B gene therapy race

Shares in uniQure ($QURE) briefly hit a new low following a negative knee-jerk reaction to fresh data on its hemophilia B gene therapy. The sharp slide, which was quickly reversed, was triggered by data showing that, for better or worse, the 9-month data on hemophilia B gene therapy AMT-060 were comparable to results generated after 6 months.

Cassiopea (SWX:SKIN) has taken control of a Phase II trial after the Israeli biotech it licensed the drug from shut down midstudy. The difficulties mean the genital wart trial has enrolled 27 patients almost three years after the protocol was filed with ClinicalTrials.gov, a situation that has forced Cassiopea to step in to prevent further delays to the study.

5. FDA grants fast-track status to Morphochem s antibiotic ahead of start of PhII

The FDA has designated Morphochem s MCB3837 as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and simultaneously put the antibiotic on its regulatory fast-track program. The regulatory rulings give Morphochem the opportunity to liaise more frequently with the FDA at a time when it is gearing up for the start of a Phase II trial.

The sharp slide, which was quickly reversed, was triggered by data showing that, for better or worse, the 9-month data on hemophilia B gene therapy AMT-060 were comparable to results generated after 6 months.

On one level, this represents a success for uniQure. With the data, the Dutch biotech has shown its gene therapy can deliver improvements in Factor IX (FIX) gene activity for at least 9 months after treatment. Four of the 5 patients in the study no longer need to receive prophylactic FIX infusions. FIX use is down 75%. And the latest FIX readings for the subjects are comparable to their steady-state levels. With the durability of gene therapies being a key factor, such sustained improvements are a boost for uniQure, particularly given that the 5 patients received a low dose of AMT-060.

The doubts about uniQure center on the response, or lack thereof, of one patient and comparisons to its rivals. After 9 months, patient 3 continues to need prophylactic FIX infusions and has FIX activity levels of below 2%. The FIX actiivity levels of the other participants range from 2.9% to 7.2%. While sufficient to end the need for prohylactic FIX infusions, data on the four stronger responders have still been used as a stick with which to beat uniQure. Rival gene therapy player Spark Therapeutics ($ONCE) has achieved 27% to 35% FIX activity in a four-person study.

Unfavorable comparisons to Spark s data caused uniQure s stock to slide 16% following the release of its 6-month results in June. A perception that uniQure faces stiff competition has contributed to the company s market cap falling to $176.4 million ( 159.1 million). As of the end of March, uniQure had  184.6 million in cash. While life on Nasdaq has been rough for uniQure over the past 9 months, it represents part of what the company signed up for when it chose to list in the U.S. The presence of other gene therapy biotechs--and the comparisons this enables--was a motivation for the U.S. IPO.

The future for uniQure rests, in part, on data from the high-dose cohort. While, barring a turnaround for patient 3, the 9-month low-dose data were always likely to receive a muted response at best, the high-dose readout gives uniQure a chance to show AMT-060 can increase FIX activity levels up toward 10% and beyond. While the full real-world implications of upping FIX activity to these levels are unclear, it has the potential to reduce the number of spontaneous bleeds and, in doing so, cut the need for on-demand FIX use.

When paired with the fact that uniQure has so far treated older patients than Spark, it uses a different vector--so may be able to carve out its own niche in the market--and it has manufacturing capacity in place, the release of upbeat data could quickly shift perceptions. The production capacity alone could prove to be critical, particularly now that other companies, notably BioMarin Pharmaceutical ($BMRN), are pursuing baculovirus-based gene therapy manufacturing.

For now, though, uniQure remains in the gene therapy doghouse.

If approved, the company expects that BMN 270 could deliver more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

The company expects that BMN 270 will be one of  four pillars of growth  that will drive BioMarin to profitability next year. The other three core opportunities are vosoritide for achondroplasia, also in the clinic, and two new candidates with regulatory filings--pegvaliase and cerliponase alfa--BioMarin Chairman and CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaim  said on a late April conference call.

Next, BioMarin plans to start a Phase IIb trial around the middle of next year for the hemophilia A gene therapy candidate, which it expects could be sufficient to support a submission for an accelerated approval by the FDA.

The latest BMN 270 data was in 9 patients. Of the 7 who received the highest dose, 6 had Factor VIII levels above 50% as a portion of their plasma with the seventh above 10%. Results seem to improve over time with the four first patients dosed having 146% of their 20-week levels of Factor VIII. The data was for follow-up ranging from 12 to 28 weeks.

Factor VIII is a blood-clotting protein encoded by the F8 gene; defects in this gene result in hemophilia A.

High-dose patients are all dosed with a steroid regimen for up to two weeks after the gene therapy dose. But the maximum ALT levels, which track liver toxicity, were roughly twice the upper limit of normal at about 12 weeks after the gene delivery and then declined over the next few weeks.

BioMarin previously noted an increase in liver enzymes in two patients who did not receive prophylactic steroids. In fact, it paused the study s dosage for an additional three patients in the study to better understand the issue.

When it presented the latest data, the company called for a subsequent study to determine optimal dose and duration for steroid therapy.

Thus far, the gene therapy has surpassed all of BioMarin s initial expectations.

 Our goal when we started the program was to increase the Factor VIII expression level in severe hemophilia A patients with Factor VIII expression levels below 1% at the time of enrollment to above 5% in order to move them from the severe level to mild or better,  Bienaim  noted in April.

BioMarin traded up 7% on the positive data on July 27 to reach a market cap of almost $16 billion.

Now, the team behind that effort is at it again with another injectable and ophthalmic play. Dubbed Nevakar, the Bridgewater, NJ-based startup has already raised $55 million.

Navneet Puri founded InnoPharma in 2005 and led the generic injectable player through the acquisition by Pfizer in September 2014, but remained as Pfizer VP of worldwide R&D until July 2015.

He left all that security at Pfizer to start and head up Nevakar which, like InnoPharma, aims to create novel formulations of existing approved drugs for injectable and ophthalmic use. Puri started his career working on parenteral drug development and drug delivery at Baxter ($BAX) and Amgen ($AMGN).

The entire four-person management team at Nevakar traces back to InnoPharma.

""Completion of this offering is a key milestone achievement for Nevakar, as it allows us to accelerate the development of our product pipeline to address significant unmet clinical and commercial needs,"" said Puri. ""Our product pipeline now contains multiple development programs that are expected to provide patient-centric benefits.""

Nevakar plans to  reposition  drugs with novel or improved formulation, improved packaging and novel drug delivery. It expects to submit to the FDA for these enhanced products via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.

The company did not disclose the identity of its investors. InnoPharma backers included Thomas, McNerney & Partners and NXT Capital, according to CrunchBase.

VCs only put about $23 million in equity, alongside $20 million in debt, into InnoPharma. That would have given investors roughly a 10x return on the $225 million upfront payment alone in that deal.

GSK will assume all activities worldwide once Janssen completes an ongoing Phase I trial.

Late last year, the FDA approved GSK s Nucala (mepolizumab) to treat severe asthma specifically for those with an eosinophilic phenotype. This subset of asthma patients typically have tissue and sputum eosinophilia and the thickening of the basement membrane zone.

In addition to the variable upfront, which presumably hinges on the Phase I outcome, Janssen stands to gain additional, undisclosed development and first commercial sales milestones, in addition to tiered royalties and  further considerations  tied to sales.

The candidate in question is CNTO 7160, a monoclonal antibody that prevents interleukin-33 from binding to the ST2 receptor (IL-33R); it s expected to be useful in severe asthma via the regulation of inflammatory cells that are key to asthma such as neutrophils and eosinophils.

 While current options for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma enable patients to achieve good control of their symptoms, there remains significant unmet need in severe patients,  said GSK Respiratory Head Dave Allen in a statement.  The IL-33 receptor antibody joins our diverse respiratory R&D portfolio of targeted biological therapies and offers the potential to block a fundamental driver of the disease. 

Respiratory disease is a core R&D area for GSK along with 5 others including oncology, vaccines, immuno-inflammation, HIV and infectious diseases and rare diseases. The pharma has a pipeline that includes next-gen approaches for asthma, COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury.

 Following our recent successful launch of a first-in-class biologic for severe asthma in an eosinophilic population, we plan to investigate this asset s potential to treat other targeted populations, for which there are currently no effective medicines,  concluded Allen.

But the company didn t raise nearly as much as it had hoped--downsizing to a $75 million offering from a planned $100 million early this week.

The biotech priced at the bottom of its proposed share range at $12. In early trading, Kadmon s share price fell to almost $10, despite elaborate backing from existing shareholders.

To get the deal done, existing investors committed to buying $40 million of the IPO, making them responsible for more than half of the completed financing but lowering the bar greatly for attracting new, public market investors.

Sam Waksal founded Kadmon in October 2010 and headed it as CEO until August 2014. Not surprisingly, this attracted considerable attention at the time given that he had pled guilty to and served jail time for charges related to insider trading at ImClone Systems including securities fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, perjury and related conspiracy charges.

He was cashed out ahead of the IPO with a severance package that could total $25 million. Sam s brother, Harlan Waksal, founded ImClone, which sold for $6.5 billion in 2008 to Eli Lilly ($LLY). He is now the President and CEO of Kadmon.

The pair has already raised and spent a staggering sum of cash through Kadmon--blowing through more than $675 million in the less than 6 years from its inception to the end of the first quarter. Even with all that fundraising, Kadmon was running on fumes with only $8.6 million in cash at March 31 with a first quarter net loss of $32.8 million.

All that cash has bought the company a pipeline headed by a pair of Phase II candidates: rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibitor KD025, which is in Phase II testing to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and for which Phase II testing is planned in moderate to severe psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) tesevatinib, which completed a Phase II trial in treatment-na ve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations and is in an ongoing trial in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations in patients with brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.

Major investors in Kadmon include Golden Tree Asset Management (18.1% post-IPO stake), Third Point Ventures (13.6%) and 3RP Holdings (7.8%).

Under the first expansion, which focuses on skeletal muscle activators targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), California s Cytokinetics has given Astellas an option to get in more deeply on the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv--its investigational skeletal muscle activator.

On top of this, the two companies have also agreed to re-write their collab to enable the development of the experimental treatment CK-2127107 in ALS, as well as boosting their joint research on the discovery of new, next-gen skeletal muscle activators through 2017.

 We are pleased to further expand our productive and successful collaboration with Astellas in the area of skeletal muscle activators and to align our interests with regard to tirasemtiv and ALS,  said Robert Blum, Cytokinetics  president and CEO.

 Advancing tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of ALS reinforces our shared commitment to deliver on the promise of fast skeletal troponin activation for people living with ALS who are fighting this dreadful disease. 

 The expansion of our collaboration illustrates Astellas  commitment to muscle disease as an important and focused therapeutic area for research as announced in our strategic plan,  added Yoshihiko Hatanaka, Astellas  president and chief.

 ALS is a disease with significant unmet needs worldwide, and we are excited to expand our collaboration with Cytokinetics to include promising drug candidates in ALS which reflect our shared interests in muscle biology. 

As part of the deal, Cytokinetics gets $65 million in committed capital from Astellas. Whether the Japanese Big Pharma decides to use it option for tirasemtiv will all depend on the results from the VITALITY-ALS trial, as well as seeing tirasemtiv on the path to market in the U.S. and Europe.

If Astellas does decide to use its option, the partners will enter into a global partnership that sees Cytokinetics working on tirasemtiv in North America, Europe, and other select countries, while Astellas will develop and commercialize tirasemtiv in other regions.

Cytokinetics is also then in line for an extra $100 million in payments associated with the exercise of the option, plus additional milestone payments and escalating double-digit royalties on Astellas  sales of tirasemtiv in its territory.

The biotech will gain another $30 million in additional R&D funding through 2017 for CK-212710--which includes Astellas  sponsorship of Cytokinetics  Phase II trial. Astellas originally put nearly $500 million in the table in the first iteration of the deal three years ago.

Cytokinetics has been working on small molecules that can boost body muscle where it counts. Amgen ($AMGN) initially stepped in as its main partner a decade ago, then expanded the deal in 2009 with a pact for omecamtiv mecarbil, a cardiac myosin activator that went through multiple Phase I and Phase II studies for heart failure.

However, Cytokinetics' shares ($CYTK) took a dive in the fall of 2013 when Amgen reported that an IV formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil failed a key Phase IIb trial, coming just weeks after Amgen paid $25 million to expand their licensing pact. A follow-up study of an oral version of the drug, though, did prove more positive last year.

Cytokinetics was up by more than 4.6% on the news early this morning.

The data, presented today at the Alzheimer s Association International Conference (AAIC 2016) in Toronto, Canada, showed the biotech s leuco-methylthioninium-bis(hydromethanesulfonate), also known as LMTX, could not best placebo when used in combination with another marketed Alzheimer s drug, such as donepezil (Aricept).

Specifically, the 15-month double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial saw the drug used in 891 people (62% female) with probable Alzheimer s, with already-approved Alzheimer s treatments being taken by 85% of study participants.

Participants were randomized to receive oral LMTX at doses of 150 mg or 250 mg/day or control (containing LMTX 8 mg/day, to maintain blinding).

Its primary targets were change from baseline on standard measures of cognition and function using the Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living.

These were both, however, missed in the Phase III trial.

In the 15% who took the drug on its own, however, there was some more positive news, as there was a statistically significant benefit on the cognitive and functional outcomes, and brain atrophy measured by MRI, in this subgroup.

This was also the first time brain atrophy was improved in an Alzheimer s study, according to the Singapore biotech, which also has a base in Scotland.

However, further, larger trials will be needed to confirm whether the candidate can on its own improve cognition.

Serge Gauthier, a professor in the departments of neurology and neurosurgery, psychiatry and medicine at McGill University and first author on the study abstract, said on a call about the results this morning that the trial was  more complicated than we thought, but monotherapy does appear to be the way forward in the future. There may have been pharmacological interactions, but we are not sure [with other Alzheimer s drugs], but this will inform future trial designs for these types of studies. 

But another investigator working on a TauRx trial said on the same call that he was  more disappointed than not  by the results.  Primary outcomes are exactly that,  he said:  They are primary. They are only thing that really counts, but it did not show any benefits. To not hit that is very disappointing. 

Maria Carrillo, Alzheimer s Association chief science officer, said in a statement:  The results of this Phase III trial are interesting but also complex, and it will take time for the field to determine what they mean.

 The small number of participants receiving the study drug as monotherapy raises very important questions. Additional research is needed to help us understand these findings so that more and better Alzheimer s therapies can be created and effectively tested. 

This may also hit the biotech s hopes of a listing on the Nasdaq, something it has previously said it was looking to do in 2017. The biotech has been much hyped over the years, with research in one way or another for a form of this target going back about 30 years. Last October, it raised $135 million to help it run its late-stage program.

It could also damage the tau theory, which sees the onset of the disease to fibrillary tangles called tau protein. Neurofibrillary tangles group in an insoluble form in neurons, affecting normal neuronal functions.

This is separate to the more popular area of research--but one also beset by failures over the past decade--called the amyloid theory, which believes a buildup and spread of this protein causes the memory-wasting disease.

A drug that is disease-modifying in AD could be worth more than $10 billion a year, but TauRx follows the likes of Pfizer ($PFE), Eli Lilly ($LLY), Biogen ($BIIB) and many others in posting weak data from its primary endpoints. Over the past 10 years, around 99% of all AD trials are believed to have failed.

Additional CDC data noted heroin overdose death rates quadrupled between 2002 and 2013 with more than 8,200 deaths in 2013. To help the issue, President Obama in February proposed $1.1 billion in new funding to address the issue.

On July 22, President Obama signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 to increase naloxone availability and boost prescription drug monitoring programs. Also last month, the White House highlighted several efforts aimed at mitigating the epidemic. One of the efforts revolves around the encouragement of safe pain management, which seeks to ease hospitals' concerns about HCAHPS survey pain management questions that impact hospital scores.

""The primary diagnosis of opioid dependency kicks off a number of medical services, including office visits, lab tests and other related treatments,"" wrote KHN's Julie Appleby, adding, ""The report found that the number of such services rendered to patients with a dependency diagnosis went from about 217,000 in 2007 to about 7 million in 2014.""

The nonprofit found 69% of claim lines -- services or procedures listed on payer claims -- for opioid-dependent individuals from 2007 to 2014 were seen in the 19-35 years-old age group. During the same time period, the same age group represented 50% of all claim lines with diagnoses for individuals who misused opioids.

""Unlike earlier opioid abuse epidemics, the present crisis is disproportionately affecting white, middle-class people in non-urban settings, including those with private health insurance,"" the report's authors concluded.

CMS announced in April the CPC+ initiative, calling the effort its ""largest-ever"" move to change U.S. primary care delivery and payment.

The model furthers the push towards preventive care with a clear focus on primary care practices. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in 2010 there were approximately 209,000 practicing primary care physicians in the U.S., adding, ""Of the 624,434 physicians in the United States who spend the majority of their time in direct patient care, slightly less than one-third are specialists in primary care.""

So CMS' project could impact a large chunk of practicing providers down the line depending on results. The agency touts the medical home model is part of broader efforts to push to rewarding quality over quantity. CMS set a goal for itself to have 50% of traditional Medicare payment transactions going through alternative payment models by 2018; 30% of such payments already do.

The model was forecasted to be rolled out up to 20 regions and hoping to accommodate up to 5,000 practices, potentially including more than 20,000 providers.

In the August 1 announcement, the agency stuck to it's estimate that up to 5,000 primary care practices could participate in the model, potentially serving around 3.5 million beneficiaries.

In May, CMS released two fact sheets on the initiative with one announcing that ACOs would be allowed to participate in the model.

Under the CPC+ model, Medicare will partner with commercial and state health insurance plans to support primary care practices in delivering advanced primary care.

That's because Medicare imposes financial penalties on hospitals for high readmissions, but even though there is no federally imposed penalty for pediatric readmissions, a growing number of states are implementing them, Kaiser Health News noted.

The most frequent causes for readmissions included issues around postoperative complications, hospital-acquired conditions, and patient assessments, with clinicians and family members tending to be too optimistic.

 One of the things we need to improve upon is engaging families at the time of discharge around how we re feeling and how they re feeling about the status of the child at that point in time,  KHN quoted lead study author Dr. Sara Toomey.

Fewer issues were related to the patient at 39.2% or the primary care physician at 14.5%, the study found. Some readmissions were a result of multiple factors, bringing the total above 100%.

Meanwhile, Anthem has leveraged its weight against the federal government, suggesting its depth of participation in the still struggling ACA marketplace is contingent upon approval of the deal.

The case should not be rushed because it debates ""the largest merger ever proposed in the healthcare industry,  the DOJ argued, suggesting that requires more pre-trial preparation time.

The DOJ filed suit against both the Anthem/Cigna and competing Humana/Aetna megamergers in late July, casting increasing doubt on whether either pair can convince antitrust regulators their deal would benefit consumers and that any concerns could be resolved via divestitures in certain markets.

While opponents argue the deals would result in decreased competition and thereby increased costs or consumers, Anthem has suggested that if allowed to merge it will be able to extend its reach to get more people covered under the Affordable Care Act--a potentially tempting proposition for the administration.

If its deal is approved, Anthem said it will increase its ACA participation by an additional nine states, as Polico reported.

As of this March, 30% of Medicare payments are tied to alternative payments models (APMs) though HHS intended to meet that goal by year's end.

The final rules for SNFs and IRFs, scheduled to be published on August 5 in the Federal Register, adopt four quality measures - three to measure resource use and one for medication reconciliation.

The new quality measures for SNFs and IRFs are:

The rule for IRFs adopts one additional measure for FY 2018 -  Potentially Preventable within Stay Readmission for IRFs.  CMS will begin reporting IRF quality data this fall.

In addition, the value-based purchasing program for SNFs, which is required by the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT), adopts a performance scoring methodology, provides feedback reports, and establishes performance standards as well as a baseline and performance periods.

 In many areas, we believe these are important changes aimed at advancing quality via the IMPACT Act and other new law,  American Health Care Association President and CEO Mark Parkinson told McKnight's.  In others, we wish a different outcome had occurred,  Parkinson added.

Under the updates, aggregate payments to skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs) are projected to increase by $920 million (2.4%) once the rule becomes effective on October 1. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) will see an increase of about $145 million (1.9%).

Payments to hospices for FY 2017 will increase by $350 million (2.1%). The cap amount for 2017, which ends on September 30, will be $28,404.99. In 2016, the cap amount was $27,820.75.

Hospices will be required to regularly collect survey data from January to December of CY 2017 for FY 2019 annual payments updates (APU) and from January to December of CY 2018 for FY 2020 APU.

CMS wants hospice care to adopt two new measures - one for assessing staff visits to patients and caregivers (Hospice Visits When Death is Imminent), and one for evaluating ""the percentage of hospice patients who received care processes consistent with guidelines"" (Hospice and Palliative Care Composite Process Measure).

The second measure will be based on the existing seven measures under the Hospice Quality Reporting Program: Pain screening, pain assessment, dyspnea screening, dyspnea treatment, patients treated with an opioid who are given a bowel regimen, treatment preferences and beliefs/values addressed.

263,What it takes to lead: A view from this hospital CEO's window," The No. 1 skill CEOs need is leadership, followed by strong financial acumen.&nbsp; ",http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/what-it-takes-to-lead-a-view-from-this-hospital-ceos-window/423619/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:43:13 -0400",,"What it takes to lead: A view from this hospital CEO's windowWhat it takes to lead: A view from this hospital CEO's window

After nearly three decades at the helm of Texas Children s Hospital, President and CEO Mark Wallace has a good idea of what it takes to lead a hospital.  Leadership is the sum of three things: Vision plus structure plus people, with people by far being the most important ingredient in the equation,  he says.

His tenure at the Houston teaching hospital has been marked by both small touches and broad strokes. When he took over the reins in 1989, Texas Children s comprised one seven-floor building with 350,000 square feet and 1,400 employees. Today, it has a constellation of buildings and facilities in 73 locations in Houston, encompassing about 11 million square feet and 11,000 employees. The hospital, ranked fourth among children s hospitals in the U.S. by U.S. News & World Report, also benefits from 1,400 full-time academic faculty members, thanks to a partnership with Baylor College of Medicine. Its FY 2015 total operating revenue was $2.84 billion.

In 2006, Texas Children s expanded its mission to obstetrics and gynecology services for women, with an emphasis on high-risk OB, maternal and fetal medicine and perinatology. Four years later, the hospital opened the Pavilion for Women. Last year, the hospital delivered 6,000 babies, 21% of them high-risk.

Today, Wallace is overseeing two major capital expansions totaling more than $900 million, which will add roughly 1.1 million more square feet of space.

The first is a $360 million, 550,000-square-foot children s hospital in The Woodlands, 37 miles north of the main campus. Outpatient clinics will open in October, followed by inpatient beds in April 2017. The second   a $575 million, 19-floor vertical expansion of the Pavilion for Women   will expand Texas Children s heart center, acute inpatient operating rooms and number and size of ICU beds. It s due for completion in July 2018.

But leading a hospital and leaving a major imprint is no easy task. In 2015, hospital CEO turnover was 18%, fueled in part by consolidation, the emergence of new care models, and movement of CEOs within health systems, according to a recent report by the American College of Healthcare Executives. With the average hospital CEO s tenure just five to 10 years, what are the keys to success?

According to Carrie Hackett, president and managing partner of executive recruitment firm Grant Cooper, leadership is the No. 1 quality search teams are looking for in a hospital CEO. They re looking for some with inherent leadership skills that engender the support and confidence of the providers, patients, and surrounding community.

While CEOs need to lead in the boardroom and in the C-suite, the best leaders are those who engage at all levels of the organization, says Wallace, who makes daily rounds to get the pulse of Texas Children s.  Employees want to see me out in the organization, talking to them, listening to them, getting answers from them and showing that I care about them,  he says.

Last summer, Wallace visited all 73 locations over a two-month period, greeting each clinician and employee, as well as many patients and family members. He spent about an hour in each place and says the experience was gratifying.  I saw the same culture in every single location   It s positive, it s upbeat, it s mission-oriented and focused on patient care and satisfaction,  he says.

A successful hospital CEO also knows how to cultivate leadership within the organization, Wallace believes.  The key to success in any organization   is leadership, and it s leadership at all levels,  he says.

Indeed, the key to the long-term success of a hospital is engaging and empowering those on the front lines of care, according to the American College of Healthcare Executives  most recent guide to effective leadership.

Next on the list of qualities today s CEO needs is financial skills. Hospitals are looking for someone  who can strategically plan, develop and execute on short- and long-term goals, and who has a solid understanding of all aspects of healthcare financing, says Hackett.  There s so much related to the finances, the way hospitals are reimbursed, and it s changing dramatically. 

Wallace agrees. With the shift to value-based medicine and population health, hospitals have to make sure that care is provided in the most appropriate medical setting.  That s what payers are asking us to do. That s what patients and families are asking us to do. And I think that was one of the major themes of the Affordable Care Act as well, to develop this ability of providing a system of right care, right place at the rime time. 

He attributes Texas Children s success not just to in large part to its physician leadership team, which he has spent a lot of time cultivating.  It s incredibly gratifying and it s made a big difference, as there s a disproportionate emphasis today on quality, on metrics, on outcomes, on measurement, on proving that we are taking good care of patients and trying to bend the cost curve at the same time,  he says.

 Executives and MBAs can t do that by themselves. We have to have physicians and clinicians at the table helping us accomplish that. 

Since hospitals are often one of the larger employers in a community, it also helps to have a strong external face. That s especially important if the hospital is nonprofit, like Texas Children s.

It s very important to tell stories to the community about Texas Children s, its mission and strategy, says Wallace.  One of the ways that we re able to offset the deficiencies in reimbursement from Medicaid and other payers is through having very successful capital campaigns   [that] help us fund our capital expansions, as well as the recruitment of outstanding physicians, nurses and others to Houston. 

According to ACHE s annual survey of top issues confronting hospitals, healthcare finance, safety and quality lead the list. To that, Wallace would add recruiting top talent, both in the C-suite and in medicine. And to do that, CEOs have to be vigilant of capital resources, operating expenses and FTEs. At Texas Children s, salaries and benefits represent about 55% of the cost structure.  It s a big challenge, especially for a [teaching hospital]   where we re taking care of the sickest of the sick,  he says.

The CEO of the future will need to be creative and innovative and think differently about healthcare delivery, says Hackett.  They re going to have to think about what is best practice for healthcare delivery for the patient and how do we get reimbursed   because, historically, it was let s keep our beds filled, and the future is not going in that direction. 

Wallace encourages young executives and physician leaders coming out of MBA programs and residencies to think about leadership and develop a clear definition that they can share with others.

 You d be surprised at how many CEOs draw a blank on being able to define leadership and what it means to them personally,  he says.  Well, it s pretty tough to be a really effective leader, to be a dynamic leader, to be transformational, if you haven t defined leadership for yourself. 

What keeps him up at night is Texas Children s 11,000 employees   70% of whom are women, many of them single mothers.  I feel a real sense of responsibility to all of our employees and making sure that we re building and sustaining a culture where they feel loved, validated and nurtured,  Wallace says.",Pharma,Pharma,"executive recruitment firm grant cooper,fy 2015 total operating revenue,add recruiting top talent,400 full-time academic faculty members,acute inpatient operating rooms,top issues confronting hospitals,major capital expansions totaling,wallace encourages young executives,19-floor vertical expansion,makes daily rounds,strong external face,successful capital campaigns   [,news & world report,strong financial acumen,1 quality search teams,physician leaders coming,affordable care act,physician leadership team,expand texas children,attributes texas children,inherent leadership skills,average hospital ceo,hospital ceo turnover,successful hospital ceo,ceo mark wallace,taking good care,disproportionate emphasis today,11 million square feet,houston teaching hospital,capital expansions,operating expenses,inpatient beds,financial skills,add roughly 1,family members,capital resources,000 square feet,square feet,major imprint,major themes,recent report,good idea,[teaching hospital],texas children,taking care,healthcare executives,000-square-foot children,hospital ceo,long-term goals,front lines,broad strokes,annual survey,real sense,effective leader,big difference,pretty tough,two-month period,ranked fourth,dynamic leader,gynecology services,37 miles north,easy task,changing dramatically,heart center,table helping,health systems,mba programs,larger employers,small touches,recent guide,healthcare financing,medical setting,beds filled,healthcare finance,population health,cost curve,healthcare delivery,big challenge,icu beds,solid understanding,managing partner,single location,outpatient clinics,single mothers,american college,main campus,strategically plan,baylor college,clear definition,hospital delivered 6,hospital opened,wallace believes,wallace agrees,wallace visited,care models,qualities today,defined leadership,cultivate leadership,define leadership,time cultivating,effective leadership,rime time,outstanding physicians,cost structure,incredibly gratifying,benefits represent,large part,fetal medicine,high-risk ob,feel loved,value-based medicine,seven-floor building,1 skill ceos,ceos draw,important ingredient,carrie hackett,surrounding community,patient care,long-term success,quality lead,recruitment,executives,ceo,children,leaders,quality,emphasis,hospital,wallace,care,today,houston,leadership,time,high-risk,physicians,gratifying,medicine,feel,part,benefits,patient,hospitals","At Texas Children s, salaries and benefits represent about 55% of the cost structure.

Since then, the company has engaged in various partnerships with academic facilities like King's College London, and biotech companies such as Spark Therapeutics and 4D Molecular Therapeutics to advance its gene therapy pipeline.

Pfizers's acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics follows the trend, as the small biotech is a clinical development company born out of an academic research institution. Bamboo is a two-year old biotech company ""formed to advance the work of Dr. Richard Jude Samulski, the Director of the Gene Therapy Center at the University of North Carolina"" and the company's founding Chief Scientific Officer.

But perhaps the most important facet of the deal is the new manufacturing facility Pfizer will pick up. In January, Bamboo acquired the University of North Carolina's Vector Core facility, an 11,000 square foot facility with a long production history for a diverse set of clients.

""We believe that having a leading manufacturing facility fully integrated into our business provides flexibility and a competitive advantage,"" stated Samulski at the time. ""We anticipate rapidly moving our programs forward, including our DMD program, which is expected to enter the clinic in early 2017.""

And Pfizer appeared to agree. Later that quarter, Pfizer purchased 22% of the company's equity, and with this week's deal, Bamboo is Pfizer's wholly-owned subsidiary.

 We believe Bamboo s industry leading capabilities in rAAV vector design and manufacturing complement Pfizer s rare disease strategy and help advance Pfizer s mission to deliver life-changing innovation to patients with the greatest needs,  said Gregory LaRosa, Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Rare Disease Research Unit.

Severe forms of the condition, which correspond to the amount of survival motor neuron (SMN) proteins lost, can result in paralysis and difficulty breathing and swallowing.

Nusinersen is designed to increase production of SMN protein by altering the splicing of a gene closely related to the lost or defective SMN gene. Biogen only released the topline findings that treatment with nusinersen led to a statistically significant improvement in the achievement of motor milestones, compared to those patients who didn't receive treatment.

But if the Phase 3 results are enough to pass muster with regulators, nusinersen would be the first approved treatment for SMA.

Another ongoing Phase 3 trial is studying nusinersen among non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA, up to 12 years old at screening.

The FDA previously granted both Orphan Drug Status and Fast Track Designation to nusinersen, and the drug has received similar designations in the European Union.

Ionis is eligible for up to $150 million in additional milestones for regulatory approvals.

Nusinersen fits nicely with Biogen's focus on treatments for neurological diseases and central nervous system disorders. The good news comes on the heels of Biogen chief executive George Scangos announcing earlier this month he would step down once a successor is found.

Revenues have more than doubled under Scangos' watch, mostly from Biogen's portfolio of multiple sclerosis treatments. But the company is also at an inflection point, recently announcing a spinoff of its hemophilia business to focus more on its core neurological portfolio.

""This performance included a negative currency impact related to the change of exchange rate applied for the translation of Venezuela operations, resulting from the evolution of the exchange system in February 2016 as well as from the persistent inability to exchange Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. dollars at the privileged official rate,"" stated the company in its earnings report.

Venezuela's pharmaceutical markets have tightened due to an ongoing public debt crisis that was sparked by the country's dependence on previously-reliable oil revenues.

And pharmaceutical companies have suffered for it, too. With less money to spend on public goods, the Venezuelan government has found itself consistently unable to fully stock its drug stores, meanwhile its black-market (but highly used) currency rate faces hyperinflation. In addition, companies like Sanofi are losing heavily on its Venezuelan bonds, previously acquired from the state oil company, as the government is unable to meet the priority exchange rate.

The company is also facing challenges throughout the rest of South America, though. Presidents in the region carry a large amount of power, and the last quarter saw two elections and one impeachment proceeding change the executive position in Argentina, Brazil and Peru.

The three countries saw center to center-right presidents replace far-left and center-left regimes, and bureaucratic change was widespread. In Argentina, for example, the health ministry is considering creating a new scientific review agency to facilitate the regulatory process.

Perhaps due to these changes, the company claims Dengvaxia's uptake and approval has been ""delayed by recent political changes and economic volatility in Latin America.""

So far, the world's first dengue vaccine is approved in Mexico, the Philippines, Brazil, El Salvador and Costa Rica. Meanwhile, public health programs for vaccination have not been widespread in the region. Second quarter sales for the vaccine stood at a meager  1 million, and the first-half sales of  20 million almost entirely corresponded to an immunization program in the Philippines.

A Brazilian state did recently announce it would begin a campaign to vaccinate 500,000 people, however.

The Pan-American Health Organization estimates a probable 1.2 million cases of dengue and severe dengue in Brazil as of early June. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports over 3.2 million cases of the fever across the Americas, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific as of 2015.

A data monitoring committee found galeterone would likely not meet its primary endpoint, leading to Tokay's decision. Galeterone was being compared to Medivation's Xtandi in the ability to lengthen progression-free survival times.

Galeterone's failure is a significant blow to the company and puts presure on its financial situation. Tokai spent roughly $10 million in the first three months of the year and would rapidly deplete its cash holdings of $44 million at that place.

Tokai still believes it can continue testing galeterone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostrate cancer (mCRPC), whose cancer has become resistant to Medivation's top-selling drug, Xtandi.

",http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/gsk-verily-launch-715-million-bet-on-bioelectronic-medicines/423611/,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:14:26 -0400",,"GSK, Verily launch $715 million bet on bioelectronic medicines Many of the processes of the human body are controlled by electrical signals firing between the nervous system and the body s organs, which may become distorted in many chronic diseases,"" said Moncef Slaoui, the chairman of global vaccines at Glaxo who will also serve as chair of the new company.

""Bioelectronic medicine s vision is to employ the latest advances in biology and technology to interpret this electrical conversation and to correct the irregular patterns found in disease states, using miniaturized devices attached to individual nerves.""

The joint company looks to combine Glaxo's drug discovery and disease biology expertise with Verily's experience in miniaturizing low power electronic and data analytics prowess.

Galvani will focus first on establishing clinical proof-of-concept for the approach in inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine diseases, notably including type 2 diabetes. Arthritis and asthma could also be possible targets for bioelectronic medicine, Glaxo said.

Glaxo's vice president of bioelectronics R&D, Kris Famm, will head the new company, which will be 55% owned by the drugmaker. Both Glaxo and Verily will contribute existing intellectual property rights, although the assets have no current carrying value due to their early-stage nature.

The investment could be seen as a vote of confidence from Glaxo in U.K.-based science after the U.K.'s recent decision to leave the European Union. Just last week, Glaxo announced a roughly $360 million expansion of its manufacturing capacity across three facilities in the U.K.

Verily has been one of Google's (now Alphabet's) most prominent ""other bets,"" or investments not tied to its search and web businesses. Led by Andrew Conrad, Verily already has partnered with Novartis, Biogen, and Johnson & Johnson for several medicine and tech collaborations.

With Novartis, for example,Verily is working to develop ""smart"" contact lens which could monitor a diabetic's blood sugar levels

But while Verily's efforts have garnered acclaim, it is reportedly struggling to prove the science behind some of its projects. A number of top people on the Verily team have left over the past year as well, according to Stat.

Glaxo has been exploring bioelectronics since 2012, led by Galvani's new president Kris Famm. Thirty scientists will initially work at Galvani, which will be consolidated in Glaxo's financial statements.

""This agreement with Verily to establish Galvani Bioelectronics signals a crucial step forward in GSK s bioelectronics journey, bringing together health and tech to realize a shared vision of miniaturized, precision electrical therapies,"" said Moncef Slaoui.",Pharma,Pharma,"contribute existing intellectual property rights,notably including type 2 diabetes,miniaturizing low power electronic,newly created company aims,verily launch $715 million bet,establish galvani bioelectronics signals,roughly $360 million expansion,data analytics prowess,establishing clinical proof-of-concept,blood sugar levels,crucial step forward,irregular patterns found,precision electrical therapies,electrical signals firing,treat chronic diseases,modifying electrical&nbsp,president kris famm,disease biology expertise,miniaturized devices attached,kris famm,chronic diseases,electrical conversation,disease states,vice president,implantable devices,endocrine diseases,bioelectronics journey,exploring bioelectronics,garnered acclaim,johnson & johnson,past year,drug discovery,initially work,european union,current carrying,financial statements,top people,recent decision,individual nerves,web businesses,bioelectronic medicines,early-stage nature,andrew conrad,global vaccines,reportedly struggling,latest advances,manufacturing capacity,thirty scientists,nervous system,contact lens,joint company,moncef slaoui,verily team,bioelectronic medicine,shared vision,develop&nbsp,-based science,tech collaborations,human body,glaxo announced","Galvani will focus first on establishing clinical proof-of-concept for the approach in inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine diseases, notably including type 2 diabetes.

271,Higher Humira sales lift AbbVie in Q2," Yet with biosimilar competition to Humira threatening, AbbVie&nbsp;has invested heavily in oncology to offset potential revenue loss in the future.&nbsp; ",http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/higher-humira-sales-lift-abbvie-in-q2/423553/,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 13:34:55 -0400",,"Higher Humira sales lift AbbVie in Q2Humira continued to be AbbVie's main breadwinner, accounting for nearly 65% of sales in the second quarter. But that lucrative revenue stream is under threat.

Earlier this month a federal panel unanimously recommended a biosimilar version of Humira made by Amgen, setting up a likely approval by the Food and Drug Administration later this year. Meanwhile the Korean biosimilar company Samsung Bioepis recently applied for European approval of its Humira copy, and plans to do the same in the U.S. (Biogen would market that biosimilar in Europe.)

Other companies, such as Coherus BioSciences and Boehringer Ingelheim, are also developing Humira biosims, eyeing to win a share of the $14 billion Humira earned last year in global sales.

The principal patent on Humira, its so-called composition of matter patent, expires in December in the U.S. and in October 2018 in most European countries. AbbVie, however, has maintained it can protect Humira from competition through 2022, when its other patents on the drug expire.

Global sales of Humira totaled $4.15 billion in the second quarter, up 17.4% from the same period a year prior.

Given such reliance on Humira, AbbVie will need strong growth from its other drugs, both approved and in development, if a competitor successfully brings a Humira biosimilar to market.

AbbVie bet $21 billion that Imbruvica could help fill any future shortfall when it bought Pharmacyclics last year. Imbruvica is already on track to reach blockbuster status this year, racking up $439 million in global sales last quarter and $820 million over the first six months of the year.

AbbVie also recently secured approval in the U.S. for its leukemia drug Venclexta and has high hopes for Rova-T, an experimental treatment for small-cell lung cancer which it acquired in its purchase of Stemcentrx. Early data showed some benefit in patients with small cell lung cancer and AbbVie said it hopes to submit the drug for third-line use sometime in 2017.

Elsewhere, sales of AbbVie's hepatitis C drug Viekira grew strongly in international markets, bringing in $332 million. But that covered up for a roughly 61% drop in year-over-year sales in the U.S., likely due to increased competition from rivals like Gilead and Merck.",Pharma,Pharma,"korean biosimilar company samsung bioepis recently applied,higher humira sales lift abbvie,federal panel unanimously recommended,offset potential revenue loss,small cell lung cancer,drug viekira grew strongly,small-cell lung cancer,recently secured approval,lucrative revenue stream,competitor successfully brings,reach blockbuster status,early data showed,developing humira biosims,leukemia drug venclexta,$14 billion humira earned,abbvie bet $21 billion,humira biosimilar,biosimilar version,humira totaled $4,year-over-year sales,humira threatening,global sales,protect humira,humira made,humira copy,biosimilar competition,drug expire,drug administration,q2humira continued,main breadwinner,experimental treatment,coherus biosciences,international markets,european countries,roughly 61% drop,so-called composition,bought pharmacyclics,boehringer ingelheim,invested heavily,principal patent,european approval,matter patent,strong growth,increased competition,abbvie&nbsp,future shortfall","Higher Humira sales lift AbbVie in Q2 Yet with biosimilar competition to Humira threatening, AbbVie&nbsp;has invested heavily in oncology to offset potential revenue loss in the future.&nbsp; Higher Humira sales lift AbbVie in Q2Humira continued to be AbbVie's main breadwinner, accounting for nearly 65% of sales in the second quarter.

Friday's announcement is a step forward for this goal, as the company centralizes its research in both focus and location, providing the company with the ability to tap into the increasingly-important biotech startup industry.

 Our goal is to become the best R&D organization in our industry, but to deliver on this, we need to first build new capabilities and embrace new ways of working,  said Andy Plump, Takeda s Chief Medical and Scientific Officer.

These new ways of working include a greater focus on acquisitions and research collaborations aimed at making the company globally competitive. So while Takeda boasts an ""exciting early-stage pipeline,"" the company's late-stage pipeline is more limited. As a result, the company appears to be looking towards R&D collaboration agreements and potential acquisitions to boost its financial potential.

Among the transformation goals outlined in the company presentation, Takeda said it is looking at new business models include joint ventures, forming a new biotechnology company, and an entrepreneurship venture program.

In addition to the new projects, the Shonan facility will open a new ""innovation research park"" supplemented by similar collaboration centers around the city. The Boston and San Diego facilities will also receive expanded resources and new lines of focus providing the company with useful hubs nearby the lead U.S. biotech communities in Cambridge and San Francisco.

Takeda expects the transformation will save the company roughly $175 million in annual savings, a sum which will be continually re-invested into pipeline products, according to the company presentation.

Although Seres is not the only company attempting to explore the relationship between the microbiome and the human body, the SER-109 phase 2 trial was the largest trial in the field to date.

But the company remained optimistic despite the trial's failure, emphasizing the technology is new and, like any new technology, had to fail at some point.

""We think that SER-109 actually is a good way of getting at this for the first time,"" said Roger Pomerantz, President, CEO and Chairman of Seres. ""We are sort of pioneering this, if you look at the literature it is not at all clear that we know the placebo rate for fecal transplants,"" he added after comparing the technology to the early years of the immuno-oncology and gene therapy fields.

SER-109 was designed to treat C. difficile infections, a healthcare associated infection affecting the gastrointestinal system following antibiotic therapies or extended stay in care facilities. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half a million people were infected with the disease in 2011 and 29,000 of these died within 30 days of diagnosis.

""C. Difficile infection treatment options, including unregulated fecal microbial transplants, remain poor,"" said Pomerantz. ""The confounding placebo data obtained in this study further highlight the significant need for new, effective, FDA regulated therapeutic options for these patients. We will take our learnings from this study and continue in our pioneering efforts to develop meaningful new microbiome therapeutics for C. Difficile infection and other serious diseases.

In food, pharma, cosmetics and biotech industries, diaphragm seals are installed to help maintain the integrity of process media for product safety and quality. Over time, however, repeated exposure harsh chemicals and extreme conditions can weaken the diaphragm membrane and cause it to fail.

A diaphragm failure can go undetected and potentially expose the process media to non-hygienic conditions. This threat of contamination can led to batch evaluation as well as the quarantine of previous batches, resulting in lengthy, costly delays.

To help avoid such issues, WIKA s Diaphragm Monitoring System provides an instant alert should a diaphragm breach occur.

The monitoring system is designed with primary and secondary diaphragms, and the space in between is evacuated. This hard vacuum is monitored by a pressure transmitter, a pressure switch or a pressure gauge. If the primary diaphragm is breached, the vacuum will be compromised -- triggering a visual, audio, or electrical alert. It s not necessary to stop operations and make repairs immediately, however. The secondary diaphragm will continue to function properly and provide reliable pressure readings until it s feasible to perform maintenance.",Pharma,Pharma,"diaphragm monitoring system alerts operators immediately,repeated exposure harsh chemicals,patented dual diaphragm design,provide reliable pressure readings,wika diaphragm monitoring systemwith,diaphragm monitoring system,make repairs immediately,diaphragm breach occur,seal assembly fails,compromised -- triggering,monitoring system,helping prevent contamination,diaphragm membrane,secondary diaphragm,diaphragm seals,diaphragm failure,primary diaphragm,pressure transmitter,pressure gauge,pressure switch,costly delays,electrical alert,non-hygienic conditions,function properly,batch evaluation,unscheduled downtime,potentially expose,product safety,extreme conditions,process media,stop operations,perform maintenance","Wika Diaphragm Monitoring SystemWith its patented dual diaphragm design, Wika's Diaphragm Monitoring System alerts operators immediately if the diaphragm in a seal assembly fails, helping prevent contamination of the process media and unscheduled downtime.Wika Diaphragm Monitoring SystemWith its patented dual diaphragm design, Wika's Diaphragm Monitoring System alerts operators immediately if the diaphragm in a seal assembly fails, helping prevent contamination of the process media and unscheduled downtime.

Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics that kill or stop the growth of bacteria. While these drugs are effective in treating serious bacterial infections, an FDA safety review found that both oral and injectable fluroquinolones are associated with disabling side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after exposure to fluoroquinolones and may potentially be permanent.

Because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the FDA has determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with these conditions who have no alternative treatment options. For some serious bacterial infections, including anthrax, plague and bacterial pneumonia among others, the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option.

FDA-approved fluoroquinolones include levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, moxifloxacin (Avelox), ofloxacin and gemifloxacin (Factive). The labeling changes include an updated Boxed Warning and revisions to the Warnings and Precautions section of the label about the risk of disabling and potentially irreversible adverse reactions that can occur together. The label also contains new limitation-of-use statements to reserve fluoroquinolones for patients who do not have other available treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The patient Medication Guide that is required to be given to the patient with each fluoroquinolone prescription describes the safety issues associated with these medicines.

Several of these sites are near genes involved in brain development.,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312032.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT",Depression,"Depression: 15 genomic regions linked with diagnosisDepression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. In 2014, there were around 15.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the U.S. who had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the last year, which represented 6.7 percent of all American adults.

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, depression is a condition in which a person feels discouraged, sad, hopeless, unmotivated, or disinterested in life in general.

At any one time, 3-5 percent of adults suffer from major depression, and the lifetime risk is around 17 percent. The disability is more common in women than men, with a median age onset of 32   years.

""Identifying genes that affect risk for a disease is a first step towards understanding the disease biology itself, which gives us targets to aim for in developing new treatments,"" says study co-author Dr. Roy Perlis, of the Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital, and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

""More generally, finding genes associated with depression should help make clear that this is a brain disease, which we hope will decrease the stigma still associated with these kinds of illnesses,"" he adds.

Depression tends to run in families across multiple generations; a person whose parent or sibling has major depression has 2-3 times greater risk of developing depression, compared with the average person.

Genetic familial studies have been unable to pinpoint variants influencing the risk for depression. Although one study identified two genomic regions contributing to disease risk in Chinese women, those particular variants are rare in other ethnic groups.

Dr. Perlis and team note that many types of depression manifest and affect people in different ways, and, as with other psychiatric disorders, depression is more than likely influenced by many genes, with effects that have previously been too subtle to detect.

The study used data gathered by genomics company 23andMe - a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company - customers of which consented to be involved in research.

Participants responded to surveys and completed questionnaires about medical history and physical and demographic information.

From the 23andMe database, more than 300,000 individuals of European ancestry were analyzed for common genetic variation. There were more than 75,000 who reported diagnosis or treatment for depression and more than 230,000 with no reported history of depression.

The analysis found two genomic regions - one containing a gene expressed in the brain that is currently poorly understood, and another gene associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability - as notably associated with the risk of depression.

Outcomes from the analysis were combined with findings from other studies: a genome-wide association study with around 9,200 individuals with a history of depression and 9,500 controls, and another from 23andMe clients, with 45,800 participants with depression and 106,000 controls.

Findings identified 15 genomic regions, including 17 particular sites - several of which were located in or close to genes involved in brain development - linked with a diagnosis of depression.

""Another key takeaway from our study is that the traditional way of doing genetic studies is not the only way that works,"" Dr. Perlis adds.

""Using existing large datasets or biobanks may be far more efficient and may be helpful for other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, where traditional approaches also have not been successful,"" he concludes.

296,Medical News Today: What are the Benefits of a Sitz Bath?,"Learn all about the uses and benefits of a sitz bath. This form of bathing could help with hemorrhoids, Bartholin's cysts, and other perianal issues.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312033.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT",GastroIntestinal / Gastroenterology,"What are the Benefits of a Sitz Bath?For people with a sensitive problem around the seat area, a sitz bath can help. This is simply a way of bathing private parts when there is a problem.

A sitz bath is designed to sit in, used for problems around the anus. A sitz bath is typically used to nurse specific medical problems with the anus area and, in women, the lower genital area. A sitz bath also provides broader relief by relaxing and cleansing the seat area, both the rear and the genitals.

For problems around the anus, the word used by healthcare professionals is ""perianal."" It's from the anatomy textbooks, to mean ""around the anus.""

Another word doctors use is ""anorectal."" Hemorrhoids, for example, occur just inside the anus - the rectum, which is the last part of the long tube that is the gut. There are also anal fissures - breaks or cuts in the skin or moist tissue around the exit ring.

Problems that sitz baths might help ease and manage include these anorectal problems. Sitz baths are also useful for other reasons, however, like bathing some infections that can affect women.

Words used for bathing the anus and intimate areas include:

The term sitz bath itself comes from the German language. Sitz simply means ""seat."" The term bidet may be more familiar. Bidets are built into some bathrooms for everyday washing of the intimate areas.

Bidets are ordinary bathing bowls or basins to fill with warm water for the seating position. They are more for general use, rather than being designed for helping to nurse medical problems.

Bidets would, though, do a similar job for intimate problems as well as for regular hygiene. Gentle showering while sitting down on the shower tray or in a bath would also.

One example of everyday health is to keep the anus clean if there are hemorrhoids. This can help prevent worse anal itching, which can be caused by hemorrhoids among other things.

Simple warm water cleaning without using too much soap, or using mild soap or cream instead, helps prevent problems. Getting itchy from a lack of hygiene can lead to scratching. Scratching makes any itching even worse and can damage the skin.

Gentle bathing is better than scratching for normal hygiene. It is also better for easing and reducing things that have already started to itch.

The plastic, medical-looking sitz baths go a bit further, and they might be more helpful for easing and reducing more difficult problems.

Such a problem could be bigger hemorrhoids or ones that push outside the anus. Sitz baths may be useful for a number of other reasons, including after surgery anywhere in the seat area. A sitz bath could help with the healing process and comfort after an anorectal or vaginal operation, for example.

Sitz baths available in the United States come at a variety of prices from around 10 to 20 dollars upward. The choice of sitz bath comes down to several factors:

In many cases, there is a type of sitz bath used by nurses that is also sold widely on the Internet and at pharmacies.

Each product is different, but common sense and reading the label are all that is needed to use a sitz bath. Most commercially available nursing sitz baths are bowl-shaped plastic trays placed over an ordinary toilet, with the seat then placed down on top of it. These trays also have overflow outlets that spill into the toilet bowl.

The sitz bath should be half-filled with warm water at a comfortable temperature. The user can add extra water without having to get up sitting in the bath for 10 or 15 minutes. The extra water comes from the tube fed by a hot water bag that is placed, high up.

Examples of common problems around the back passage that can benefit from a sitz bath include:

For these problems, a sitz bath should perhaps be taken after emptying the bowel.

With fissures, warm bathing helps to improve blood flow to the affected area. Bathing also soothes pain and prevents hygiene problems.

Although they are different problems, both hemorrhoids and fissures are also helped by increasing fiber in the diet.

People should not be embarrassed to talk to a doctor about long-lasting or severe problems around the anus. Treatment or advice is always available.

For some more serious problems, it may also be important to look at other medical and surgical options. Sitz bathing is often just one part of a larger management plan for anorectal problems.

The vaginal opening surrounded by the labia lets out normal as well as abnormal secretions and discharges.

These fluids come out of the woman around the lower part of her genital area. This seat area is between the lower part of the external vagina and the anus.

The vagina area, the anus area, and the skin in between, can all need cleaning. More cleaning can be needed if more fluids are coming out of the vagina area.

Infection is one example of a medical problem that can happen around a woman's genitals. An infection may benefit from sitz bathing in addition to medical help.

The bathing could help with the discharge problems that can occur with the Bartholin's glands. These glands produce fluid to lubricate sex. They are usually pea-sized glands that are not noticeable and cannot be felt.

There is a noncancerous growth that can happen to Bartholin's glands and cause problems for women. They can become enlarged and painful, and can get infected. Along with the medical diagnosis and care needed for any cysts and infections, sitz bathing can be helpful.

Women should always check any unusual genital changes or discharge by asking a doctor about them. Some problems, like itchy thrush infection, can be tackled with self-care if they return in the future. However, new problems should always be checked.

Other problems that could lead women to need sitz bathing are hemorrhoids, issues relating to pregnancy, and childbirth.

297,"Medical News Today: Higher BMI may not raise risk of heart attack, death, finds twin study","A new twin study finds a higher BMI may not increase the risk of heart attack or death, though it does raise the risk of type 2 diabetes.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312034.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT",Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,"Higher BMI may not raise risk of heart attack, death, finds twin studyBody mass index (BMI) is a tool used to measure body fat and assess how it may influence the risk of associated health problems.

For adults, BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight by their height, and from this, they are given a score that places them into one of four categories:

Obesity has become a major health problem in the United States, currently affecting more than a third of American adults and raising their risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.

But according to study co-author Peter Nordstr m, Ph.D., of Ume  University in Sweden, and colleagues, a higher BMI may not necessarily raise the risk of heart attack and death.

The researchers came to their findings after analyzing 4,046 monozygotic - or identical - twin pairs, using data from the nationwide Swedish twin registry and the Screening Across Lifespan Twin (SALT) study.

The authors explain that because monozygotic twins are genetically identical, they enable the assessment of obesity-related health risks independent of genetic factors.

In all twin pairs, one twin was heavier than the other, with a higher BMI. Overall, the leaner twins had an average BMI of 23.9, while the heavier twins had an average BMI of 25.9.

During an average 12.4 years of follow-up, the team assessed the incidence of heart attack, death, and type 2 diabetes onset among each twin pair, and looked at whether this might be associated with BMI.

For more than 3,200 of the twin pairs, the team also gathered data from questionnaires that detailed changes in BMI 30 years prior to study baseline.

Overall, the researchers found that in each twin pair, the heavier twin - even those who had a BMI of 30 or more - was at no higher risk of heart attack or death during follow-up than the leaner twin.

In detail, there were a total of 203 heart attacks (5 percent) and 550 deaths (13.6 percent) among the heavier twins, the authors report, and 209 heart attacks (5.2 percent) and 633 deaths (15.6 percent) among the leaner twins.

Additionally, the researchers found changes in BMI in the 30 years before study baseline appeared to have no influence on the later risk of heart attack or death.

When it came to onset of type 2 diabetes, however, the researchers found that the heavier twins were at greater risk than the leaner twins; a total of 345 cases of type 2 diabetes occurred among the heavier twins during follow-up, compared with 224 cases among the leaner twins.

Furthermore, they found that twins who had experienced an increase in BMI in the 30 years before study baseline were more likely to later develop type 2 diabetes, regardless of their baseline BMI.

Based on these latest findings and those of previous studies, Prof. Nordstr m and colleagues say the importance of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes is ""indisputable.""

""These results suggest a causal link between obesity and the risk of diabetes, independent of genetic influence,"" they note.

However, while the authors say their study is unable to conclude that a higher BMI does not raise the risk of heart attack or death, they believe the results raise questions about the efficacy of weight loss strategies against such conditions:

The researchers point to a number of study limitations. For example, the height and weight of the twin pairs were self-reported, which may have influenced the results.

Additionally, they note that they did not gather information on subjects' waist circumference - an indicator of central obesity - which they say has been more strongly linked to CVD than BMI.

298,Medical News Today: Does eating meat increase risk of death?,"Eating animal protein increases risk of death, whereas eating plant-based protein is linked to a lower risk of death, suggests a new study.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312039.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT",Nutrition / Diet,"Does eating meat increase risk of death?Dr. Mingyang Song - from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston - and colleagues publish their work in JAMA Internal Medicine.

They note that protein sources ""inevitably influence other components of diet, including macronutrients, micronutrients, and phytochemicals, that can in turn influence health outcomes.""

As such, they say accounting for food sources is of extreme importance in better understanding the health effects of different types of protein.

Previous studies have promoted vegetarian diets for their health benefits, while others have cautioned against meat consumption for potential health risks.

A recent study, for example, suggested that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, another study suggested red meat consumption is linked to kidney failure.

To further investigate, Dr. Song and colleagues examined data from two large studies in the United States that used repeated measures of diet through food questionnaires as well as 32 years of follow-up.

In total, there were 131,342 study participants, 64.7 percent of whom were women; the average participant age was 49.

The researchers examined risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in light of eating animal protein versus plant protein. Additionally, they adjusted for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors.

Results showed that every 10 percent increase in animal protein from total calories was linked with a 2 percent higher risk of death from all causes and an 8 percent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

This increased risk of death linked to eating more animal protein was more noticeable among the study participants who were obese and those who drank larger quantities of alcohol.

Interestingly, eating more plant protein was linked with a 10 percent lower risk of death from all causes for every 3 percent segment of total calories and a 12 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

Additionally, the link between eating more plant protein and lower risk of death was stronger among the participants who smoked, drank at least 14 grams of alcohol per day, were overweight or obese, were physically inactive, or were younger than 65 or older than 80.

Commenting on their findings, the researchers write:

""In fact,"" they add, ""protein from certain fish, such as cod, has been suggested to improve the lipid profile, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity.""

The researchers also discovered that substituting just 3 percent of calories from animal protein with plant protein was linked with a lower risk of death from all causes.

Despite the strengths of the large sample size, repeated dietary assessments, and high follow-up rate, the team points to some limitations.

Firstly, the study population had a moderately higher protein consumption compared with the general U.S. population, which limits the researchers' ability to examine effects of the very low end of animal protein intake.

Additionally, because this is an observational study, they could not exclude residual confounding, which is the distortion that can remain even after controlling for confounding factors. However, the researchers say their ""results are robust.""

""Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, especially from processed red meat, may confer substantial health benefit,"" they conclude. ""Therefore, public health recommendations should focus on improvement of protein sources.""

299,"Medical News Today: Breastfed preterm babies may have better IQs, working memory, motor function","Preterm infants fed breast milk within the first 28 days of life have better brain development and neurocognitive outcomes, finds a new study.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312013.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Pediatrics / Children's Health,"Breastfed preterm babies may have better IQs, working memory, motor functionThe study, led by Brigham and Women's Hospital, followed 180 preterm infants from birth to 7 years old.

The results showed that the preterm babies that received more breast milk within the first 28 days of life had larger deep nuclear gray matter volume at full term and better IQs, academic achievements, memory, and motor function by age 7.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breastfeeding rates are rising in the United States, and in 2011, 79 percent of newborns started to breastfeed. However, at 6 months, 49 percent were breastfeeding, and 27 percent at 12 months, which is below the recommended guidelines.

With the known health benefits of breastfeeding for infants, children, and mothers, the CDC say that it is a key strategy to support mothers in initiating and continuing breastfeeding through professional lactation support.

Mandy Brown Belfort, M.D., a researcher and physician in the Department of Newborn Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and lead author, says: ""Our data support current recommendations for using mother's milk to feed preterm babies during their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization.""

""This is not only important for moms, but also for hospitals, employers, and friends and family members, so that they can provide the support that's needed during this time when mothers are under stress and working so hard to produce milk for their babies,"" she adds.

Children who were born before 30 weeks' gestation and enrolled in the Victorian Infant Brain Studies cohort from 2001-2003 were included in the analysis.

Breastfed babies were determined as those infants who received breast milk as more than 50 percent of their nutritional intake from birth to 28 days old. Regional brain volume data was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ""full term,"" as if the baby was born at 39-40 weeks of gestation, and at 7 years old.

Also observed by the team were cognitive measures of IQ, reading, mathematics, attention, working memory, language, visual perception, and motor testing at the age of 7.

Infants who were fed mostly breast milk on more days during NICU hospitalization had more nuclear gray matter volume - an area that processes and transmits neural signals to other brain areas - at term age equivalent.

By the age of 7, these same children were able to perform better in IQ, working memory, and motor function tests.

Findings from the study revealed that ingesting more breast milk correlated with better outcomes for preterm babies, larger regional brain volumes at full term, and improved cognitive ability at 7 years old.

""Many mothers of preterm babies have difficulty providing breast milk for their babies, and we need to work hard to ensure that these mothers have the best possible support systems in place to maximize their ability to meet their own feeding goals. It's also important to note that there are so many factors that influence a baby's development, with breast milk being just one.""

According to Belfort, future studies by the team will revolve around using other MRI techniques to find out how human milk intake influences the structure and function of the brain.

Further research also needs to focus on how the role of breastfeeding differs from other types of maternal care and nurturing on the development of a preterm baby's brain.

300,Medical News Today: Why do women orgasm? Study may hold the answer,"By assessing the evolution of the female orgasm across mammalian species, researchers find it may have once played a direct role in human reproduction.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312026.php,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Sexual Health / STDs,"Why do women orgasm? Study may hold the answerStudy co-author Gunter Wagner, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University in New Haven, CT, and colleagues publish their findings in the Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B Molecular and Developmental Evolution.

Wagner notes that previous studies that have attempted to uncover the reasons why women orgasm have focused on ""evidence from human biology and the modification of a trait rather than its evolutionary origin.""

In an attempt to address this research gap, the team conducted an analysis of how orgasms have evolved across a wide range of species.

Specifically, they looked at whether a certain physiological trait associated with the human female orgasm - the release of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin - arises in other mammals with a placenta, and if so, what role it plays.

The team explains that there is an abundance of physiological characteristics that can be traced across mammalian evolution.

For example, they point out that the ovarian cycle in female humans does not depend on sexual activity, whereas ovulation is induced by males in other mammalian species.

From their analysis, the researchers found that evolution of male-induced ovulation occurred first, while spontaneous ovulation derived from this, evolving later.

As such, the researchers speculate the female orgasm may have once had a direct role in reproduction - in other words, it acted as a reflex to trigger ovulation. They suggest that this reflex evolved to become redundant; it is now simply a feeling of pleasure during sexual activity.

The team also points to research that compared genitalia across placental mammalian species.

It was found that, alongside the evolution of spontaneous evolution, the position of the clitoris - the female sex organ that, when stimulated, can induce orgasm - also evolved; it was once located in the copulatory canal.

Wagner and colleagues suggest that this modification reduced the likelihood that the clitoris gains sufficient stimulation during sexual intercourse, and as such, the release of the orgasm-inducing hormones prolactin and oxytocin through sexual intercourse is less likely.

""Homologous traits in different species are often difficult to identify, as they can change substantially in the course of evolution. We think the hormonal surge characterizes a trait that we know as female orgasm in humans. This insight enabled us to trace the evolution of the trait across species.""

People should speak with their healthcare provider for recommendations for treating their particular skin condition.

Acne is classified by healthcare providers as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Acne can also be classed as mild, moderate, or severe.

Milder forms of acne include non-inflammatory acne. This acne includes the presence of blackheads and whiteheads. These blemishes are caused by a skin oil called sebum clogging the pores.

While sebum may seem like a problem, it is vital for moisturizing the skin. Sebum leads to various forms of acne when a layer of dead skin cells blocks the body's release of sebum from the skin's pores.

Sebum is made by the sebaceous glands. Areas that have lots of these glands such as the face, chest, back, and shoulders are at a higher risk of acne formation.

Inflammatory acne is characterized by moderate and severe forms of acne. This can lead to blemishes such as pimples, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.

Mild acne is characterized by the presence blackheads or whiteheads, as well as few or small pimples.

Moderate acne is characterized by the presence of papules and pustules, which are caused by bacteria. The presence of bacteria leads to skin irritation and inflammation.

Severe acne is a more harsh form of moderate acne and additionally features the presence of nodules and cysts.

Not all acne spots are given the same name due to their characteristics and include:

302,Medical News Today: Antibiotic resistance: Skin infection prevention treatment helps battle 'superbugs',A new therapy has been developed to prevent skin infections through open wounds in hospitals and protect against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312008.php,"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",MRSA / Drug Resistance,"Antibiotic resistance: Skin infection prevention treatment helps battle 'superbugs'""Superbug"" is a term invented by the media to describe bacteria that cannot be killed using multiple antibiotics. These bacteria are ""antibiotic resistant"" and have proven particularly problematic in healthcare settings where they increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death.

A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). People with MRSA are estimated to be 64 percent more likely to die than individuals with a non-resistant form of the infection.

Although MRSA is a significant threat to patients, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that life-threatening MRSA infections in healthcare settings are declining.

MRSA is usually spread by direct contact with an infected wound or from contaminated hands. Studies show that 2 in 100 people carry MRSA in their nose without any signs of infection and can spread the bacteria to others.

The research was trialed in a human model of 3D tissue engineered skin and showed that the proteins prevented bacterial infections, and indicated that the treatment was both safe and effective for use in humans.

Prof. Sheila MacNeil, from the University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who engineered the skin, created the model to mimic the tissue structure of normal adult skin, including infected wounds. The skin can be used to analyze the penetration of peptides and bacteria.

In collaboration with AGE U.K., researchers from the University of Sheffield showed that while infection is launched by bacteria tightly attaching to skin cells by hijacking ""sticky patches"" - by using proteins called tetraspanins from human cells - the patches are made less sticky, allowing bacteria to be washed away.

""This development is a huge breakthrough in the fight against antibiotic-resistance,"" says Dr. Pete Monk from the University's Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Science, who led the study.

He notes that skin infections, including bedsores and ulcers, can be concerning for patients who may already have debilitating conditions, and have proven to be a significant problem for modern healthcare.

Monk adds that the therapy could be administered in the form of a gel or cream, and could also work well as a dressing. ""We're hoping it can reach clinical trials stage in the next 3 to 5 years,"" he concludes.

In contrast to antibiotics, tetraspanin proteins do not directly kill bacteria, and, as a result, do not encourage the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

303,Medical News Today: People who produce powerful HIV antibodies have specific immunological profile,Scientists hope that new findings about variations in HIV antibody profiles may help in the search for a successful vaccine to prevent the disease.,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312012.php,"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",HIV / AIDS,"People who produce powerful HIV antibodies have specific immunological profileHIV is a serious disease that, if not controlled, can become AIDS. It can be fatal. There is currently no vaccine to protect against HIV or AIDS.

A person with HIV will experience symptoms that feel like the flu. As the virus spreads through the body, the immune system will launch an attack by HIV antibodies to fight the virus.

In around 45 days, the immune system normally gains control, in a process called seroconversion. In some people, this can take a few months. However, the virus does not go away.

It remains in the body, and it can continue to affect cells and cause damage, because the virus is still active. The virus also mutates as the immune system pursues it.

As the body's immune system becomes weaker, the person is more likely to develop different infections. When a person's body can no longer fight common infections, this is known as AIDS.

Previous research has indicated that monoclonal antibodies, or mabs, can protect against HIV infection in monkeys.

The bodies of some patients who live with HIV naturally produce a type of antibody known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Scientists believe that any successful vaccine against HIV must be able to induce bNAbs.

A team led by researchers from Duke University in Durham, NC, studied blood samples taken from people with HIV. They selected 51 people with high levels of bNAbs and 51 people with few or no bNAbs.

They found that many of the changes in immune cell function that stem from chronic HIV infection are linked with high bNAb levels.

The results suggest that bNAb production may correlate with specific differences in individual immune functions, and that these differences could occur when HIV infection is not kept under control.

Their theory is that in people with this particular immune system profile, the activity of antibody-producing immune cells, known as B cells, could be less restricted.

This could be because these B cells are supported by T follicular helper cells. They may also be hindered by regulatory T cells.

These conditions could make some people more likely to produce protective bNAbs.

It is thought that bNAbs may help to suppress the virus in people who have them by neutralizing a number of HIV viral strains. Other people with HIV have different immunological profiles.

While bNAbs cannot completely clear HIV infections in people who already have HIV, scientists hope that the new insights into bNAbs could be a step toward developing a successful vaccine to prevent the virus.

The researchers hope to find a safe way to replicate these qualities in people who do not have HIV infection, through a vaccine. If the bodies of people who do not have HIV can be stimulated to produce bNAbs, this could provide protection from the virus.

This, they believe, could lead to better experimental vaccines that would protect against HIV.

The findings support existing approaches to developing an HIV vaccine. These involve changing a person's immune system so that it can mimic these conditions. This could be achieved by adding boosters, such as adjuvants, to vaccines.

The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Blood samples were collected with the help of by the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), which is supported by NIAID.

The research - published in the journal Nature Communications with funding from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) - demonstrates that the device containing a small droplet of cells in a liquid can be used to produce a single dose of treatment.

According to senior author Tim Lu - an associate professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science, and head of the Synthetic Biology Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Research Laboratory of Electronics - the device could essentially be carried to isolated and inaccessible places and either used to treat patients on the spot or manufacture a vaccine to prevent disease outbreak.

""Imagine you were on Mars or in a remote desert, without access to a full formulary, you could program the yeast to produce drugs on demand locally,"" says Lu.

The portable production system uses a programmable strain of yeast - Picha pastoris (P. pastoris) - that can be stimulated to express one of two therapeutic proteins when exposed to a particular chemical trigger.

P. pastoris can grow to very high densities on simple and inexpensive carbon sources and can express large amounts of protein. ""We altered the yeast so it could be more easily genetically modified and could include more than one therapeutic in its repertoire,"" says Lu.

Exposing the modified yeast to estrogen  -estradiol resulted in the cells expressing recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH), and upon exposing the cells to methanol, the yeast expressed the protein interferon.

Senior author Rajeev Ram, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, and colleagues initially developed the device. They devised a compact millimeter-scale microbioreactor - containing a microfluidic chip - that could store the cells. Kevin Lee, an MIT graduate and co-author of the paper, commercialized the system.

The microbioreactor works by feeding a liquid containing the chosen chemical trigger into the reactor to mix with the cells. This mixture is surrounded on three sides by polycarbonate, and on the fourth side is a flexible and gas-permeable silicone rubber membrane.

By pressurizing the gas above the membrane and massaging the liquid, the user can ensure the cell-and-chemical mixture is thoroughly blended.

""This makes sure that the 1 milliliter (of liquid) is homogenous, and that is important because diffusion at these small scales, where there is no turbulence, takes a surprisingly long time,"" says Ram.

The membrane is gas permeable, which enables oxygen to stream through the cells, while any produced carbon dioxide can be easily extracted.

Conditions such as oxygen levels, temperature, and pH are monitored by the device within the microfluidic chip to ensure the environment is at optimum levels for cell growth. The device also detects cell density.

The simple action of flushing liquid through a filter can allow a new chemical trigger to be added to the cells to stimulate the yeast to produce the next required protein.

In previous experiments, other researchers have attempted to develop microbioreactors, but these have not had the ability to retain the protein-producing cells after the liquid they are mixed with is flushed out.

Future work by the team involves using the system in combinatorial treatments, whereby multiple therapeutics - such as antibodies - are used simultaneously. Lu points out that combining multiple therapeutics can be expensive if it each requires a production line of its own.

""But if you could engineer a single strain, or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost,"" he concludes.

305,Medical News Today: Everything You Need to Know About the Pap Smear,"Learn all about the Pap smear, a screening tool to detect cervical cancer cells. This article looks at Pap smear results and what age you should have one.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311995.php,"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Cervical Cancer / HPV Vaccine,"Everything You Need to Know About the Pap SmearCervical cancer is cancer that develops in the cells of the lower portion of the uterus. This region is called the cervix.

The small and narrow cervix connects the uterus to the vagina. It provides an entry for sperm to pass into the uterus. The cervix also provides an exit from the uterus for monthly menstrual blood flow or a baby during delivery.

The small cervix is divided into two sections and is home to two types of cells:

Where these two cell types join is where most cervical cancers and precancerous cells form.

A Pap smear is a screening tool which will aid in the detection of abnormal cells and cancer. It works by sampling cells from the cervix.

Cervical cancer screening is important for the prevention and early diagnosis of cervical cancer. Tools such as the Pap smear and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing are necessary to detect:

Treatment can then be offered based on the diagnosis.

An HPV test can be obtained at the same time. It is recommended that women over 30 years old undergo both a Pap smear and HPV testing.

According to the American Cancer Society, deaths from cervical cancer have decreased by more than half in the last 40 years. They say that this is mainly due to the use of the Pap smear.

Women usually have a Pap smear during a gynecological pelvic exam. A tool called a speculum is inserted into the vagina so that the cervix can be fully examined. A sample of the cervical cells is then taken with a brush or spatula and sent for testing.

The Mayo Clinic recommend avoiding undergoing a Pap smear during a period. Women should also avoid the use of douches, vaginal medications, spermicides, and having sex for 2 days before Pap testing.

Recommendations on Pap smear frequency depend on several factors. These include:

It is recommended that women start receiving Pap smears at the age of 21. They should have another test every 3 years until the age of 65. Testing every 5 years can be considered in women over 30 who undergo a Pap smear with HPV testing.

In some situations, it may be recommended that women stop undergoing screening with a Pap smear. Some women may no longer require screening after a total hysterectomy, surgery in which the uterus and cervix are removed.

Women who have a hysterectomy for a precancerous or cancerous condition require continued surveillance, however.

Women who are over 65 years old usually no longer require Pap smears. However, each person's risk factors vary. Women with a history of positive cervical cancer screening and those who are sexually active with multiple partners may require continued testing.

Each person's needs are different and should be discussed with a doctor.

A Pap smear can sometimes be negative when there are abnormal cells present on the cervix; this is called a false-negative result. False-negative results can be caused by:

On the other hand, a positive Pap smear result does not always mean that cervical cancer is present. The result may simply be abnormal.

If a patient receives a negative result, their Pap smear was normal and did not reveal abnormal cells.

Abnormal results, referred to as positive findings, may signal the presence of abnormal cells or cancer. These results require following up with a colposcopy, with or without a biopsy.

During a colposcopy, the cervix, vulva, and vagina are magnified with a colposcope. If necessary, a biopsy may be taken for evaluation.

It is important to speak with a doctor about the risk factors for developing abnormal cervical cells and cervical cancer. These will determine how often a woman will need to have Pap smear testing.

Additional testing may be recommended based on personal history and previous Pap smear and HPV results.

It is estimated that in 2016, there will be 12,990 newly diagnosed invasive cervical cancers in the United States.

There are many risk factors for developing cervical cancer. The biggest risk factor is an infection with HPV, a sexually transmitted skin-to-skin virus. HPV can be caught during vaginal, anal, or oral sex when there is skin-to-skin contact.

While there are over 150 types of HPV, most cervical cancers are caused by HPV types 16 and 18. Other complications from an HPV infection include the presence of noncancerous warts or papillomas.

While there is no cure for HPV, the body often resolves the infection on its own. When it becomes a long-term infection, the risk of cancer increases. Treatment does exist for HPV-related warts and cell changes.

306,Medical News Today: How a blood pressure hormone can cause weight gain,"Researchers have uncovered a mechanism by which a hormone system that controls blood pressure can also promote weight gain, causing obesity.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312004.php,"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,"How a blood pressure hormone can cause weight gainSenior study author Justin Grobe, Ph.D., assistant professor of pharmacology at the University of Iowa, and colleagues published their findings in the journal Cell Reports.

While the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in blood pressure control is well established, previous studies have indicated the RAS is also involved in energy balance and metabolism, suggesting the hormone system influences weight.

According to Grobe and colleagues, whether RAS promotes weight gain or weight loss depends on where in the body it is active. For example, if the RAS is highly active in the brain, it increases energy expenditure by boosting resting metabolism, which leads to weight loss.

However, If peripheral RAS activity is increased - that is, if there are high levels of the RAS hormone angiotensin circulating in the rest of the body - it reduces resting metabolism, causing weight gain. Heightened peripheral RAS is often found in obese individuals.

""At a very simplistic level, you can think of the brain RAS as the gas pedal on metabolism and the peripheral (circulating) RAS as the brake, with angiotensin as the driver,"" explains Grobe.

For their study, Grobe and colleagues set out to investigate the mechanisms by which the peripheral RAS dampens resting metabolism, with the aim of bringing us closer to a strategy that could halt this process.

The team analyzed mice that had been genetically modified to have excessively heightened RAS activity in the brain.

Compared with control mice, the genetically modified mice had greater resting metabolic rate and weight loss, even though they had the same diet and physical activity levels.

On analyzing the fat tissue of both groups of mice, the researchers found that the subcutaneous fat on the hips of the genetically modified mice showed increased heat production - or thermogenesis - while visceral fat surrounding the internal organs did not.

Subcutaneous fat refers to fat that is directly under the skin, and it is considered by some health professionals as a ""healthy"" fat. Visceral fat, however, which is stored deep in the abdominal area, is considered an ""unhealthy"" fat, raising the risk of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease.

Next, the team activated a receptor called angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) in the subcutaneous fat cells of the mice. AT2 is normally activated when the peripheral RAS is increased.

After the AT2 receptor was activated, the researchers found the mice gained weight, despite experiencing no changes in diet or food intake.

In detail, they found that AT2 activation lowers the production of a protein called UCP1 in subcutaneous fat cells, which is key for non-shivering thermogenesis. Lower UCP1 levels impair fat cells' ability to generate heat, the team notes.

""If the fat cell is the thermogenic tissue (generating heat by burning calories), you can either have a bigger engine or you can push the gas pedal harder to create a larger effect,"" explains Grobe. ""Our study shows that angiotensin is modulating the size of the engine (amount of UCP1), not how hard the gas pedal is being pushed.""

Overall, the researchers say their findings suggest that increased peripheral RAS activity - through increased angiotensin levels - promotes obesity through AT2 activation and impaired thermogenesis.

307,Medical News Today: Antioxidant suppression eradicates pancreatic cancer cells,"Researchers from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory demonstrate a drug therapy that suppresses antioxidants, resulting in the death of pancreatic cancer cells.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311993.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 09:00:00 PDT",Pancreatic Cancer,"Antioxidant suppression eradicates pancreatic cancer cellsAccording to the American Cancer Society, around 53,070 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the Unites States in 2016, and around 41,780 people will die of the disease. Pancreatic cancer accounts for about 3 percent of all cancers in the U.S. and about 7% of cancer deaths.

Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal, uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas.

A research team at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York finds that reducing levels of antioxidants in pancreatic cells can help to kill them. This new strategy for eradicating pancreatic cancer cells may open new doors for treating this serious illness, in which less than 5 percent of patients survive 5 years.

""Antioxidant"" has become a popular buzzword that is viewed as a cure-all notion for health ailments; it is widely believed that raising levels of antioxidants stops cancer cells from developing.

In reality, although antioxidants interact with and neutralize free radicals and prevent them from causing damage, there is little available evidence that antioxidants prevent cancer.

Furthermore, trials have found that people taking antioxidant supplements during cancer therapy have worse outcomes, especially if they were smokers.

In a series of complex experiments, the CSHL researchers demonstrate that in pancreatic cells that are abnormal or in a malignant state, raising antioxidant levels can do more harm than good.

In healthy cells, the amounts of oxidizing and anti-oxidizing agents are kept precisely balanced in every cell.

However, in proliferating cancer cells - that are increasing rapidly in number through growth and cell division - the amounts of oxidants in malignant cells increase, but anti-oxidants also increase to counter the impact of rising oxidation.

CSHL's Prof. David Tuveson - M.D., Ph.D., director of research for the Lustgarten Foundation - and colleagues note that without the amounts of antioxidants going up in scale with the oxidants, malignant cells will die from excessive oxidation.

""Of course, that's exactly what we want cancer cells to do - to burn themselves out,"" says Iok In Christine Chio, a postdoctoral investigator in the Tuveson lab who led the experiments.

""The therapeutic principle our lab is testing is whether, by increasing the level of oxidation in cancer cells, we can cause pre-malignant and malignant cells to die,"" she adds.

Treatments for cancer such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy destroy cancer cells by promoting oxidation. Although antioxidants protect cellular DNA from damage by oxidative , they likely protect cancer cells, too.

Exposing cells to excessive oxidation causes them to experience programmed cell death called apoptosis. A method of increasing oxidation in cancer cells is to decrease levels of antioxidants within the same cells.

Tuveson and team aimed to find a technique whereby they could increase oxidation without harming healthy cells. They concentrated on NRF2, a protein that can be tweaked to disrupt the balance between oxidation and decreased cancer cells.

When NRF2 is active, cells synthesize a chemical called glutathione, an important antioxidant. However, it is not possible to reduce NRF2 activity or make it inactive, as it has a role in regulating several hundred different genes. ""One can't delete it from a cell without impacting many other processes,"" says Chio.

The team used samples of pancreas cells from people with pancreatic cancer (malignant and pre-malignant) and individuals with a healthy pancreas to conduct an experiment where NRF2 was eliminated.

They found that when NRF2 was missing, the process of translating messages from the genes into proteins was highly affected by the oxidant and antioxidant balance, but only in the cancerous cells. The healthy cells were still able to produce the proteins.

The crux of the experiment was to use two drugs in combination: an AKT (protein kinase B) inhibitor, and a BSO (buthionine sulfoximine), which reduces levels of glutathione.

AKT inhibitors have been used in trials on cancer patients before but with limited success. The team wanted to combine this with the BSO to mimic what would happen if they could reduce levels of NRF2.

""We were able to test this idea and see that this approach was synthetically lethal - it did increase the killing power of the AKT inhibitor, but the synergy was not present in the setting of normal pancreas cells,"" Chio says.

308,Medical News Today: Gluten sensitivity: Biological mechanism uncovered,"A new study opposes the idea that non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not exist, after identifying a biological explanation for the condition.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312001.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 08:00:00 PDT",Food Intolerance,"Gluten sensitivity: Biological mechanism uncoveredIn a study published in the journal Gut, researchers led by Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) in New York, NY, suggest gluten sensitivity may arise as a result of a weakened intestinal barrier, which triggers an inflammatory immune response when gluten is consumed.

Proteins found in wheat, rye, barley, and triticale all fall under the gluten category. They are present in a variety of foods, primarily breads, cereals, and pasta.

It is estimated that around 1 in 141 Americans have celiac disease - an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the small intestine in response to gluten intake, causing symptoms such as bloating, constipation, chronic diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting, and chronic fatigue.

As many as 18 million Americans, however, are believed to experience similar symptoms in response to gluten intake, but they do not have the intestinal damage that arises with celiac disease, nor do they possess the associated tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies.

This condition is known as gluten sensitivity, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or non-celiac wheat sensitivity. It is defined by the Celiac Disease Foundation as ""a condition with symptoms similar to those of celiac disease that improve when gluten is eliminated from the diet.""

Gluten sensitivity has long baffled scientists, who have been unable to pinpoint the underlying mechanisms of the disorder.

This has led to some researchers suggesting that gluten sensitivity is not a real condition, and that symptoms that arise in response to gluten among people without celiac disease are psychological.

However, the new study - led by Armin Alaedini, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Columbia - appears to have identified a biological explanation for gluten sensitivity, providing evidence that the disorder is not all in the mind.

The new research involved 80 individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, 40 individuals with celiac disease, and 40 healthy individuals.

The individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity all reported experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming foods containing gluten, including wheat, barley, and rye, the team reports; such symptoms disappeared when gluten-containing foods were removed for a period of 6 months, and they returned when re-introduced.

The researchers took blood samples from all three groups, which they used to pinpoint markers of immune system activity.

In the blood samples of individuals with celiac disease, the researchers found no markers of increased innate immune system activity, despite this group experiencing significant intestinal damage.

This suggests that the intestinal immune response in people with celiac disease has the ability to neutralize microbes that travel through the damaged intestinal barrier, the team says, which stops an inflammatory response from occurring.

For individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, however, it was a different story; the researchers found that, while they did not possess the cytotoxic T cells found in people with celiac disease, they did have a marker of intestinal cell damage, alongside markers of acute systemic immune activity.

According to the authors, this finding indicates that patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity have a weakened intestinal barrier as a result of intestinal cell damage, which triggers inflammatory immune activity in response to gluten.

Additionally, the researchers found that markers of intestinal cell damage and immune system activity among individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity normalized when they refrained from eating gluten-containing foods for 6 months, further supporting their theory.

The team suggests it may one day be possible to use such markers to diagnose non-celiac gluten sensitivity; at present, no diagnostic tests for the condition exist. The markers could also be used to monitor patients' response to treatment.

""These results shift the paradigm in our recognition and understanding of non-celiac wheat sensitivity and will likely have important implications for diagnosis and treatment,"" says study co-author Dr. Umberto Volta, professor of internal medicine at the University of Bologna, Italy.

""Considering the large number of people affected by the condition and its significant negative health impact on patients, this is an important area of research that deserves much more attention and funding.""

309,Medical News Today: Locking doors in mental health hospitals does not lower suicide rate,"Whether mental health care centers have a locked or open door policy does not appear to impact rates of absconding or attempting suicide, says a study.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312003.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 PDT",Mental Health,"Locking doors in mental health hospitals does not lower suicide ratePeople with mental health problems have a higher risk of suicide than the general population. Some hospitals that offer psychiatric care lock their wards to try to reduce this risk, while others leave rooms open.

Researchers in Germany have compared outcomes for locked and unlocked accommodation in a 15-year study of around 145,000 patients. The authors believe that an open door policy may be preferable, as it can promote a better therapeutic atmosphere and more positive health outcomes.

Authorities around the world are increasingly using locked-door policies to keep patients safe from harm, but locked doors also restrict personal freedom.

European countries tend to follow traditional approaches in caring for patients in psychiatric care, because there has been little evidence so far that one method is better than another.

The current study examined data from 21 German hospitals between 1998 and 2012 to see how locked and open door policies might correlate with rates of suicide, attempted suicide, and absconding.

Of 349,574 patients, they selected 72,869 cases from each hospital type, or 145,738 cases altogether. Creating matched pairs enabled a direct comparison between hospitals.

Most of the patients had brain disorders relating to dementia, substance use, schizophrenia, and affective disorders, including mood disorders, such as depression, stress-related, and personality disorders.

They looked at the numbers of completed suicides, attempted suicides, leaving and then returning, and absconding without return.

They then factored in whether the hospital had an open door policy or not, and whether the wards were locked, partly locked, open, or if they were day clinic wards.

Findings revealed similar rates of suicide and attempted suicide, regardless of whether a hospital had a locked door policy or not. Furthermore, hospitals with an open door policy did not have higher rates of absconding, either with or without return. Patients who left an open door hospital without permission were more likely to return than those from a closed facility.

Patients attending open and day clinic wards were less likely to abscond, either with or without returning, compared with locked and partly locked wards.

The number of attempted suicides was also lower among those staying in an open ward, compared with a locked ward, but rates of completed suicide were similar.

Given the similarity of outcomes between the two types of hospital, the researchers propose that an open door policy might be preferable.

Since each hospital serves a specific location, there was no chance of higher-risk patients being allocated to hospitals with locked wards. This reduced the risk of bias.

The authors warn that an open door strategy might not be appropriate everywhere, as mental health care provision differs in other ways, too, for example, how many beds are available, the percentage of acutely ill patients, and how long they are treated for.

Germany has around 1.1 psychiatric care beds for every 1,000 people, compared with 0.5 beds per 1,000 in the United Kingdom and 0.3 in the United States. Where there are fewer beds, patients who receive treatment are more likely to be severely ill and more at risk.

Nevertheless, the authors believe that the findings raise important questions, not just in Germany but beyond, and they call for further studies to confirm the applicability of their findings to mental health services elsewhere.

The study did not look at suicide, self-harm, or harm to others among people who absconded and did not return, since data for these patients were not available.

Co-author Professor Undine E Lang points out, however, that: ""Most people with mental health disorders are at greater risk of suicide and self-harm than of harming others."" Other studies have suggested that ""very few"" people who abscond go on to harm themselves or others.

In a linked comment, Prof. Tom Burns, of the Department of Psychiatry at the Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford in the U.K., notes that psychiatric care is shifting toward exercising a greater degree of control. He notes that traditional approaches do not necessarily match patients' needs and situations.

This, he says, raises issues of patients' rights and is at odds with the stated aims of national strategies to use the least restrictive option.

A core skill in mental health care practice, he says, is to develop trusting relationships with patients, and particularly with those who are most troubled and severely ill. A control-oriented approach can lose sight of this key principle.

If this skill is lost, says Prof. Burns, it could be very difficult to get back. He calls for the re-establishment of therapeutic engagement and continuity of care as priorities in mental health care.

310,Medical News Today: Okra: Health Benefits and Nutritional Information,"Learn all about the health benefits and nutritional content of okra. As well as the benefits, this article offers some okra recipe suggestions.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311977.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 06:00:00 PDT",Nutrition / Diet,"Okra: Health Benefits and Nutritional InformationOkra is a warm-season vegetable popular in the southern United States, parts of Africa and the Middle East, the Caribbean, and South America.

The small green pods of okra are also called gumbo or ladies fingers.

The taste of okra is mild and similar to eggplant. It has a unique texture with peach-like fuzz on the outside and mini edible seeds on the inside of the pod.

Okra is a nutrition powerhouse full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

This MNT Knowledge Center feature is part of a collection of articles on the health benefits of popular foods. It provides a nutritional breakdown of okra and an in-depth look at its possible health benefits, how to incorporate more okra into your diet, and any potential health risks of consuming okra.

According to the National Nutrient Database, one cup of raw okra (around 100 grams) contains:

One cup of okra provides the following percentages of recommended daily nutrient intake:

Okra also provides a lesser amount of calcium, iron, vitamin A, niacin, phosphorus, and copper.

Eating fruits and vegetables of all kinds has long been linked with a reduced risk of many lifestyle-related health conditions.

Many studies have suggested that eating more plant foods like okra reduces the risk of conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Eating more plant foods may also help with increasing energy levels and keeping a healthy complexion and hair.

Lectin is a type of protein found in okra, beans, peanuts, and grains. Lectin from okra was used in a study to treat human breast cancer cells. The treatment reduced cancer cell growth by 63 percent and killed 72 percent of the human cancer cells.

People who do not eat enough folate are at a higher risk for breast, cervical, pancreatic, lung, and other cancers. Researchers are unsure of why folate intake and cancer risk are connected.

There is no evidence that taking a folate supplement lowers the risk for cancer. As a result, getting folate from food like okra is important. Getting enough folate is especially important for women who are pregnant and people who are dependent on alcohol.

More studies need to be done to see if okra has an effect on cancer in humans.

In a 2011 study, researchers made a powder from the peel and seed of okra to treat rats with diabetes. The rats that were treated with the powder had lower blood sugar and fat levels than rats that did not receive the powder.

According to the American Heart Association, eating foods that are high in fiber can reduce harmful cholesterol levels in the blood. High-fiber foods lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes. Fiber can also slow heart disease in people who already have it.

People should aim to get at least 25 grams of fiber per day from vegetables, fruits, and legumes. It is best to choose whole grains over processed grains like white breads and snack cakes. Okra has 3.2 grams of fiber per cup.

Foods that are high in vitamin K like okra are good for the bones. Vitamin K helps the bones to absorb calcium. People who eat a low amount of vitamin K are more likely to have fractures.

Okra and leafy greens such as Swiss chard, arugula, and spinach add vitamin K and calcium to a diet. Just one cup of okra has 66 percent of an adult's daily need for vitamin K.

Fiber in the diet also helps to reduce appetite and may aid in weight loss.

Okra is easy to grow in hot climates. People should choose okra that is taut and firm to the touch. It is best to avoid pods that are shriveled or soft. Once the pods start to turn dark on the ends, they will go bad if they are not used soon.

People should keep okra dry and in the crisper drawer in a paper or plastic bag to keep it from getting slimy or moldy. Fresh okra does not last for more than 3-4 days. Users should not wash okra until it is ready to be used.

Okra is used as a thickener in many dishes. It can be roasted, pickled, saut ed, fried, stewed, or boiled. Cutting okra and cooking it in moisture releases the slimy juice that increases the thickness of soups and stews.

Some people do not enjoy the ""gummy"" texture that okra gets when it is chopped and prefer to cook the whole pods quickly to avoid it.

Try these healthy and delicious recipes developed by registered dietitians using okra:

Okra is rich in fructans, a type of carbohydrate that can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and bloating in people with bowel problems. People with irritable bowel syndrome and other gut conditions are more likely to be sensitive to foods high in fructans.

Okra is also high in oxalates. The most common type of kidney stone is made of calcium oxalate. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, high oxalate foods can increase the risk of these stones in people who have had them previously. Other high oxalate foods include spinach, rhubarb, and Swiss chard.

Okra contains a compound called solanine. Solanine has been linked to joint pain, arthritis, and long-lasting inflammation for a small percentage of people who may be sensitive to it. Solanine is found in many fruits and vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, blueberries, and artichokes.

There have been no studies to suggest reducing solanine intake for the general population. It is worth remembering that vegetables and fruit in general help to reduce inflammation.

Eating foods like okra that are high vitamin K can affect people taking blood-thinning drugs like warfarin. Blood thinners are used to prevent harmful blood clots that can block blood from getting to the brain or heart.

Vitamin K helps the blood to clot. People who are at risk of blood clots should not suddenly increase or decrease the amount of vitamin K they eat. People should aim to keep their intake of vitamin-K-rich foods steady from day to day.

It is the total diet or overall eating pattern that is most important in disease prevention and achieving good health.

311,Medical News Today: App trains healthcare professionals to detect early stage skin cancer,"A new app helps doctors learn to assess and detect skin cancer at early stages, lowering risks and reducing unnecessary referrals.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311919.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Melanoma / Skin Cancer,"App trains healthcare professionals to detect early stage skin cancerThe new app, called Dermofit, has been designed to help train non-specialist doctors, nurses, and medical students to more accurately identify different skin lesions and growths along with their related diagnoses, using interactive, cognitive training techniques and an extensive image reference library.

Launched earlier this month, Dermofit is already in use in a range of medical training settings around the world, helping healthcare professionals develop a greater knowledge of the variety of visual characteristics that different skin lesions have, and the way that these can be used to determine benign cases from more serious examples of skin cancer.

Dermofit was first devised by Prof. Jonathan Rees, grant chair of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh, who came up with the idea to develop a digital tool to help medical professionals accurately identify malignant and benign skin lesion and skin growths at an early stage.

The result of 4 years of research and development by the University of Edinburgh, Dermofit provides trainee doctors, nurses, and other non-specialist healthcare professionals with digital resources that allow them to hone their ability to correctly identify specific skin lesion types and, as a result, improve the accuracy with which they can determine skin cancer diagnoses.

In the case of suspected skin cancers - including malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or basal cell carcinoma - the need for prompt referral to a specialist for assessment and treatment is essential. However, in many cases, these referrals are often unnecessary.

""Thirty percent of doctors will automatically send a patient to a hospital if they have signs of a skin growth,"" says Prof. Rees. ""But the evidence is that the vast majority of people who are seen and referred do not have skin cancer or anything serious at all.""

Resources that can equip non-specialist care practitioners with the skills necessary to more accurately identify these different types of skin growth and lesion can therefore be extremely valuable, in terms of improving the quality of care provided to patients and also reducing costs for care providers.

Dermofit uses algorithms that automatically groups library photos of skin lesions based on their color and texture properties.

Selecting from a library of more than 1,300 images, the Dermofit app will take the user to further sets of similar lesion types to illustrate the difference in lesions that may look similar but are from different skin lesion classes. Other modules allow users to further build and test their skills of identification and diagnosis.

Bob Fisher, who specializes in computer vision and helped design the computer algorithms for the app, adds: ""Dermofit contains a photo library of skin lesions to help inform practitioners to diagnosis more effectively.""

Practitioners can click on the image of a lesion of interest which then leads to further similar lesions. As lesions are selected, further sets of similar lesions are displayed. This gives familiarity with the different skin lesion types and allows users to differentiate between lesions that look similar, but that are from different skin lesion classes,"" he says.

The use of cognitive teaching tools is a rapidly growing area of medical training, as it allows healthcare professionals to develop the necessary skills that are required to more accurately diagnose and treat patients within risk-free digital environments.

Providing healthcare practitioners with training tools like Dermofit helps them acquire skills that would otherwise require years of practical experience.

Simedics, a U.K.-based company specializing in digital products and publishing for the healthcare industry, is the commercial partner responsible for bringing Dermofit to market. They hope that the product will become instrumental in providing an effective way to train medical students and primary care practitioners in this area and, as a result, help improve skin cancer detection rates and patient care.

The company is already working with teaching hospitals, universities, and organizations around the world to incorporate Dermofit into teaching regimens.

More information on the Dermofit project is available at dermofit.org.

Dermofit is available on iOS and can be downloaded from the App Store.

312,Medical News Today: What is a Hiatal Hernia?,"Learn all about hiatal hernias, where part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm. This page looks at hiatal hernia causes, symptoms, and treatment.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311963.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",GastroIntestinal / Gastroenterology,"What is a Hiatal Hernia?A hernia is where internal tissue or part of an organ pushes through a weakness in the body part's ""wall"" that normally keeps it in.

The insides of the belly are held in the abdominal cavity by the abdominal wall, for example. That is the wall affected by inguinal hernias.

The organs of the abdomen are also kept in place by the diaphragm. The diaphragm separates the abdominal cavity's organs from the heart and lungs in the chest cavity. It is a dome-shaped muscular layer between the two cavities.

The diaphragm is the part of the body that is affected by a hiatal or hiatus hernia. This muscle moves up and down for breathing. There are no open holes in the diaphragm, but key structures and vessels run through it.

The biggest one of these is the food pipe, named the esophagus. It runs down from the back of the mouth to the stomach, connecting the two, and is critical for pushing food down.

Just above the stomach, the diaphragm normally:

This narrowing down of the esophagus helps to keep the contents of the stomach from coming back up the chest part of the food pipe.

A hiatal hernia is where part of the upper stomach pushes through the diaphragm at this usually snug point. Part of the stomach can ""herniate"" at this ""hiatus"" if the opening is weakened.

Experts do not fully understand all of the causes of the weaknesses that result in hiatal hernias.

A hiatal hernia is thought to be caused by pressure pushing up on the diaphragm. There may be inherited genetic factors that make some people more at risk from pressure.

The weakening has been linked to a number of risk factors that make it more likely. Hiatal hernias are more common among people:

Other risk factors include upward strain because of weightlifting. Even straining to push out a stool when emptying the bowel can be a factor. So too can persistent coughing or vomiting. These temporarily increase the pressure inside the abdominal cavity.

A hiatal hernia is seen more often in pregnant women. The abdominal organs are simply pushed upward during pregnancy. This sometimes causes the bulging through the diaphragm at the esophagus.

A defect in the diaphragm present at birth is another cause, but these hiatal hernias are rare.

Injury affecting the diaphragm can also lead to a hiatal hernia, such as trauma from falls or traffic accidents. Some food pipe surgeries carry the risk of one developing. This risk ought to be far outweighed by the benefits whenever a surgery is needed, however.

The stomach bulging up as a hiatal hernia often gives no symptoms. It is often detected only by chance in people who have a scan for another reason.

These hernias are split into two broad forms:

Both types are often without symptoms. The symptoms that are caused by hiatal hernias are the result of acid going up from the stomach.

Acid going up from the stomach can cause heartburn - a burning sensation around the lower chest area. Heartburn tends to worsen in relation to different foods and drinks or happens when lying down and bending over, especially when done soon after eating. It can produce a bad taste in the back of the throat, as well as bloating and belching.

If the heartburn symptom in particular becomes a regular problem, people have acid reflux. Acid reflux is a condition when heartburn keeps on happening at least twice a week.

If acid reflux happens too regularly for too long, this can progress to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The heartburn, acid reflux, and GERD's relationship to a hernia, though, is that:

The risk of a hiatal hernia related to obesity means that tackling obesity could prevent it, or at least help with controlling symptoms. Other known causes and risk factors are not preventable. In all cases when there are symptoms, these can be managed.

For any hiatal hernia, changes to eating and drinking can help. Dietary tips to help against hiatal hernias producing heartburn symptoms include:

Items that may need reducing include:

The timing of eating and drinking can be a factor because mealtimes affect when acid can flow back into the esophagus.

People should have meals 3 hours of more before lying down to bed. They should also sit up while eating.

The British National Health Service add another tip. Real problems with acid might be helped by raising the head end of the mattress so that the bed slopes slightly toward the feet. If this is worth trying, they state, raise the whole body length of the bed into a slope. Using only pillows to raise just the head could put pressure on the abdomen and make acid problems worse.

If a hiatal hernia is causing enough of a problem with acid reflux, doctors may prescribe a drug to reduce stomach acid and heartburn symptoms.

Treatments to relieve symptoms are also available over the counter without prescription:

Only rarely do hiatal hernias need surgery in hospital under general anesthesia:

The operations for hiatal hernias are done through a large open incision or a few keyhole cuts. As with any general surgery, there are downsides, but these should be outweighed by the upside of treatment of a serious problem.

313,Medical News Today: Alzheimer's drug shows promise for patients in phase III trial,"Researchers complete the first ever phase III trial of a drug that reduces formation of tau 'tangles' in the brain, offering hope to Alzheimer's patients.",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311990.php,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 PDT",Alzheimer's / Dementia,"Alzheimer's drug shows promise for patients in phase III trialTau is considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; the protein can form twisted fibers in the brain called ""tangles,"" which are believed to cause nerve cell death.

In a study recently presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2016 (AAIC 2016), held in Toronto, Canada, researchers reveal how a drug called LMTX shows promise for halting the formation of tau tangles.

Alzheimer's disease is estimated to affect 5.4 million people in the United States, and by 2050, it is expected to affect around 13.8 million Americans, unless new treatments are identified that tackle the disease at its roots.

For years, scientists have worked to find ways to combat the two prime suspects for Alzheimer's development: tau tangles and amyloid plaques - clumps of beta-amyloid protein, which are believed to disrupt nerve cell communication.

Medical News Today have reported on some interesting developments in this field; a study earlier this month, for example, revealed the creation of a vaccine that researchers say could halt the formation of tangles and plaques.

While an undoubtedly exciting development, it will still be another 3-5 years before this vaccine can be tested in humans, and this long road to human trials been the case for the vast majority of Alzheimer's studies - until now.

Dr. Serge Gauthier - of the Departments of Neurology & Neurosurgery, Psychiatry, and Medicine at McGill University in Canada - and colleagues have completed the first ever phase III trial of a drug that targets the tau protein, and the drug in question - LMTX - proved beneficial for a small subgroup of patients.

According to the researchers, LMTX - developed by TauRx Pharmaceuticals - is a tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI), meaning it targets the tau protein in the brain and prevents it from forming tangles that contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

For their phase III trial, Dr. Gauthier and colleagues enrolled 891 patients of an average age of 70.6 years who had mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were recruited from 115 sites over 16 countries across Asia, Europe, North America, and Russia.

Participants were randomized to receive one of three treatments for 15 months: oral LMTX at a dose of 150 milligrams daily, oral LMTX at a dose of 250 milligrams daily, or a control dose of 8 milligrams of LMTX daily - the placebo - in order to maintain blinding to treatment.

Around 85 percent of subjects were also using other forms of approved treatment for Alzheimer's, the team reports.

At study baseline and every 13 weeks thereafter, subjects underwent brain imaging and standard tests of cognitive functioning and day-to-day functioning, including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL).

Results of LMTX efficacy and safety were assessed as a whole and by disease severity, region, and the use of other Alzheimer's treatments.

Across the full study population, LMTX at both doses was found to have no benefit for cognitive functioning, daily functioning, or brain atrophy - the loss of nerve cells - compared with the placebo.

However, the team found that patients who were not using any other approved Alzheimer's treatment - that is, they only used LMTX - showed improvements in cognitive and daily function, as well as reduced brain atrophy. These effects were found for both doses of LMTX.

At least one adverse event was reported by more than 80 percent of participants. Gastrointestinal problems, nervous system disorders, infections and infestations, and renal and urinary disorders were the most commonly reported conditions.

While the study only demonstrated the benefits of LMTX for a small number of Alzheimer's patients, the researchers are encouraged by the findings.

""In a study of this size across a combined mild to moderate patient population, it is both encouraging to see improvements of this magnitude in the standard cognitive and functional tests and reassuring to see the supporting brain scan evidence of a slowing in disease progression during 15 months of treatment,"" says Dr. Gauthier.

""As a practicing clinician I see Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers every day, and continually share their desperate need for a truly therapeutic product as today we only have symptomatic treatments available to us. In a field that has been plagued by consistent failures of novel drug candidates in late-stage clinical trials and where there has been no practical therapeutic advance for over a decade, I am excited about the promise of LMTX as a potential new treatment option for these patients.""

While the results clearly hold promise for a much-needed treatment that targets Alzheimer's at its core, the researchers that more studies are required to determine why LMTX does not appear to work in combination with other therapies.

""The results we see in those patients not taking Alzheimer's disease medications show the considerable potential of LMTX as a monotherapy for both mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease,"" says Prof. Claude Wischik, of Aberdeen University, United Kingdom, and co-founder of TauRx.

""However, the reason for the observed loss of efficacy of LMTX when taken in combination with currently available treatments for Alzheimer's disease is not as yet understood.""

314,Medical News Today: Just 1 hour of exercise offsets health risks of prolonged sitting,A study analyzing trends in global physical activity finds that health risks associated with sitting for 8 hours can be eliminated by 1 hour of exercise.,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311964.php,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 09:00:00 PDT",Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness,"Just 1 hour of exercise offsets health risks of prolonged sittingThe study forms the first part of a four-paper series published by The Lancet that provides an overview and update of worldwide trends of physical activity and the global impact of physical inactivity.

The first series observing physical activity was released in 2012 ahead of the Summer Olympic Games. The study authors caution that there has been little progress in tackling the global pandemic of physical activity since the 2012 Olympics, with a quarter of adults worldwide failing to meet physical activity recommendations.

In the analysis, the researchers posed the question: Does exercise reduce or eradicate the harmful effects - including increased risk of early death - that are associated with prolonged sitting?

Health risks that are linked to physical inactivity include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, with recent estimates suggesting that more than 5 million people die each year globally due to failing to meet daily activity levels.

Findings from the second part of the series - a world-first study to estimate the economic burden of physical inactivity worldwide - shows that globally in healthcare expenditure and lost productivity, physical inactivity cost the world $67 billion in 2013.

""Physical inactivity is recognized as a global pandemic that not only leads to diseases and early deaths, but imposes a major burden to the economy,"" says Dr. Melody Ding, senior research fellow at The University of Sydney's School of Public Health, Australia.

Dr. Ding notes that if no action is taken to improve population levels of physical inactivity, the economic burden of physical inactivity is projected to increase globally, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week.

In the first paper of the series, the researchers analyzed 16 studies, which included data from over 1 million people.

The team formed four groups of individuals based on their level of moderate-intensity exercise, ranging from 5-75 minutes per day. Moderate-intensity exercise was defined as walking 3.5 miles per hour or cycling at 10 miles per hour.

Results from the study show that people that spend 8 hours a day sitting but are physically active have a significantly lower risk of death than people who spend fewer hours sitting, but who are not physically active.

Moreover, the increased risk of death associated with spending 8 hours sitting was eliminated by 1 hour of physical activity per day.

People who had the greatest risk of death were those individuals who sat for prolonged periods and were mostly inactive. They were between 28-59 percent more likely to die early, compared with those in the most active group, which is a similar risk to that associated with smoking and obesity.

The study finds that only around 25 percent of participants did an hour or more exercise per day.

""There has been a lot of concern about the health risks associated with today's more sedentary lifestyles,"" says Prof. Ulf Ekelund, of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences, Norway, and the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

""For many people who commute to work and have office-based jobs, there is no way to escape sitting for prolonged periods of time. For these people in particular, we cannot enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it's getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work. An hour of physical activity per day is the ideal, but if this is unmanageable, then at least doing some exercise each day can help reduce the risk,"" he adds.

Also observed in the study was time spent watching TV per day - a particular type of sedentary behavior - in a subgroup of approximately half a million people.

Watching TV for 3 hours per day was associated with an increased risk of death in all activity groups, except among the most active. The authors say that this association could be because long hours watching TV may be a marker of a more unhealthy lifestyle in general, including being less likely to take exercise.

In a third paper in the series looking at the progress and challenges in physical activity since the 2012 Olympics, Prof. Jim Sallis, of the University of California-San Diego, says: ""The global pandemic of physical inactivity remains, and the global response has been far too slow.""

The fourth and final paper highlights the need for collaboration between schools, transport, sports, and recreation and environmental sectors to increase levels of physical activity and monitor physical inactivity as a risk factor for negative health impacts.

""Large-scale problems require large-scale solutions, and we need commitment from governments, as well as international organizations to tackle the global public health challenge of physical inactivity. Science and practice are providing important evidence, but now is the time for action,"" says Prof. Rodrigo Reis, of Washington University in St Louis, MO.

Dr. Pam Das, senior executive editor, and Dr. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, say in a linked comment: ""The world needs to get serious about physical activity. And that means money - for capacity in public health departments to undertake adequate surveillance, cross-sector partnerships, interventions, policy monitoring, and research, especially the cost-effectiveness of interventions.""

""There is extensive evidence about the need for action to improve physical activity, what actions are most promising, and who needs to be involved. But capacity and funding remain insufficient because physical activity is not taken seriously enough to rise to the top of the funding priorities,"" they conclude.

The European Commission has cleared the drug's use - with or without ribavirin (RBV) - for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 or GT4 infection in adults.

Zepatier is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet containing elbasvir (50mg) and protease inhibitor grazoprevir (100mg), administered for 12 weeks.

The drug belongs to the next-generation of hepatitis therapies called direct antivirals, which block the action of proteins essential for viral replication, in Zepatier's case NS3/4A and NS5A.

Approval was based on clinical trial data showing that sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the completion of therapy was achieved in 96 percent (301/312) of chronic HCV GT1b-infected patients given MSD's therapy.

In chronic HCV GT1a-infected patients, 93 percent (483/519) and 95 percent (55/58) achieved cure following treatment with Zepatier for 12 weeks or Zepatier plus RBV for 16 weeks, respectively. Also, 94 percent (61/65) and 100 percent (8/8) of chronic HCV GT4-infected patients achieved cure in the treatment groups.

Chronic HCV infection, caused by a blood-borne virus, is a major public health concern affecting more than 170 million people globally, 15 million of whom are living in Europe. Of the six genotypes of chronic HCV infection, GT1 is the most common in Europe accounting for around 66 percent of cases.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has now issued guidance to healthcare professionals not recommending Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) on the NHS in England for people with CF ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation.

According to Vertex, the Institute recognised the drug as a ""valuable new therapy for managing cystic fibrosis"" with significant clinical benefits as well as ""wider benefits to society for people with cystic fibrosis and carers"".

But it concluded that because of uncertainties over its impact on lung function - a key measure of improvement - particularly in the long-term, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates for various scenarios fell well outside of what is normally considered value for money for the NHS.

However, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust argues that new long-term data not considered by NICE suggests Orkambi almost halves the rate of decline in lung function in people with CF over a two-year period, potentially adding years of life.

The charity's chief executive, Ed Owen, said the decision ""demonstrates the weakness of the current NICE assessment process that the long-term value of the drug in slowing the decline in lung health is not sufficiently recognised"".

319,Controversial CDF revamp launches,"England's Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) reopens under its new model, but the industry is warning that it could do little to solve fundamental problems with drug reimbursement.",http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/controversial_cdf_revamp_launches_1085589,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 10:41:14 +0100",,"England's Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) reopens under its new model today, but the pharma industry and charities are already warning that it could do little to solve fundamental problems with drug reimbursement in the country.

The original CDF, a silo fund for cancer drugs deemed too expensive for the NHS by NICE, was closed in March after heavily overspending. The new system will hand all the decisions to NICE   if a drug is given a conditional recommendation, the CDF is allowed to fund the use of the medicine for up to 2 years while further evidence on long-term evidence is gathered.

After 2 years, NICE will conduct a review, using a shortened process, to consider the drug for routine commissioning on the NHS. This will either result in the medicine moving out of the CDF and into routine budgets, or if the company has not been able to demonstrate its case, made available on an exception basis only.

But Baroness Morgan, chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Now, has said that the new CDF ""will do next to nothing to solve the wider problems that are preventing NHS patients from accessing the best cancer drugs"".

She added: ""The CDF was set up because NICE's methodology was not working for cancer drugs and this new process offers little change. With the fund's drug assessment now being handed back to NICE, we worry that patients in England will miss out on effective drugs that are available in other countries.""

 

Industry warnings

Her sentiment has been echoed by Richard Erwin, general manager of Roche UK.

""Now that the assessment of new cancer medicines for reimbursement has been returned to NICE, we must, as a matter of urgency, address the challenge they have in assessing the real clinical value of cancer treatments   which necessitated the creation of the original CDF in 2010,"" he said.

  

""We are calling on government today to review NICE's assessment methodology to stop patients facing ongoing anxiety around the availability of existing and new cancer medicines.

 

He highlighted Roche's Perjeta (pertuzumab), for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer, as one example: ""We have been waiting more than two years for a final decision on Perjeta for the treatment of metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, where NICE's methodology is unable to find combination treatments cost-effective, even when they significantly extend overall survival for late stage disease. This, despite Perjeta being the highest clinically-scored medicine ever assessed by the CDF.""

  

""We   NICE, patient organisations, the pharmaceutical industry and NHS England   must all work together to ensure patients in the UK have access to the latest medicines. This means finding ways to ensure patients have access to effective and potentially game changing treatments. It is heartbreaking to think we may have years of R&D sitting on a shelf with patients unable to benefit.""

The ABPI has said that it welcomes the way the new Fund ""joins up the dots"" between NICE and NHS England, but also pointed out that further evolution of NICE's appraisal process is required.

""Importantly, we also believe that given the fact that the old Fund consistently overspent significantly on its allocated budget, and that industry already underwrites the majority of expenditure on branded medicines over and above agreed levels, a fairer and more equitable system of financial risk must be prioritised,"" the Association added.

David Montgomery, Pfizer UK's oncology medical director, has also provided his own warning: ""Developing these medicines takes an enormous investment of time, money and knowledge with thousands of scientists dedicating years to invent the latest treatments and cures. This is a high risk industry and it is not as simple as, or sustainable to, continuously ask companies to drop the price of these specialist medicines.

320,New international AMR partnership launched,"The US government has announced a new global partnership to tackle the health threat posed by antimicrobial resistance, involving two UK partners.",http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/new_international_amr_partnership_launched_1085558,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 10:27:41 +0100",,"The US government has announced a new global partnership to tackle the health threat posed by antimicrobial resistance, involving two UK partners.

CARB-X   Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator   is a new organisation that hopes to rejuvenate the pipeline of anti-microbial drugs and diagnostics. It will coordinate R&D funding of at least $350 million over the next five years, allowing the organisation to deploy significant resources to address the unique set of scientific and commercial challenges that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) creates.

The international partnership will support a suite of products through early preclinical development to a stage where they can be taken forward by private or public investment.

The Biomedical Advanced Research Authority (BARDA), within the US Department of Health and Human Services, is to provide $30 million in grants to CARB-X during the first year and up to $250 million over five years.

The AMR Centre, which is based at Alderley Park in Cheshire, is one of five organisations in the partnership. The Centre is expected to receive up to $14 million in matched funding from CARB-X in year one   and $100 million in total over the next five years. The combination of its own resources and the contributions from CARB-X means that in the AMR centre expects to be able to focus $200 million on a range of R&D projects. These financial resources will be used to help small and medium sized businesses progress their R&D projects into clinical trials.

""The creation of CARB-X is one of the most important steps yet in terms of rethinking how we deal with AMR and the partnership will have an impact around the world,"" said Dr Peter Jackson, steering group chairman of the AMR Centre. ""We share the same goal of accelerating a new pipeline of treatments and diagnostics by working on new drug development programs. We will do this in our own labs as well as in collaboration with other organisations, in particular providing support to small and medium-sized businesses and research institutes which have exciting new approaches to AMR.""

The UK's Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation focused on biomedical research, will also contribute funding, along with its expertise in overseeing projects of this kind.

""Our hope is that the combination of technical expertise and life science entrepreneurship experience within CARB-X's life science accelerators will remove barriers for companies pursuing the development the next novel drug, diagnostic, or vaccine to combat this public health threat,"" said Joe Larsen, acting BARDA deputy director.

The potential drug, CNTO 7160, is an anti-IL-33R monoclonal antibody currently in phase I clinical development. The deal is an exclusive, worldwide licence agreement covering all therapeutic fields.

 

CNTO 7160 is a biological therapy that prevents interleukin-33 from binding to the ST2 receptor (IL- 33R) and could be applicable to a broad spectrum of patients with severe asthma.

 

""There is strong human genetic evidence and target biology linking the IL-33 pathway to asthma and regulation of inflammatory cells known to be important in asthma, including neutrophils and eosinophils,"" says GSK in its announcement. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will assume all development, manufacturing and commercialisation activities worldwide with the exception of the ongoing phase I study, which Janssen will continue to run through to completion.

 

Janssen will receive up to  175 million including an upfront payment, development and first commercial sales milestones, and tiered royalties on sales.

 

""While current options for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma enable patients to achieve good control of their symptoms, there remains significant unmet need in severe patients,"" said Dave Allen, head of respiratory R&D at GSK. ""The IL-33 receptor antibody joins our diverse respiratory R&D portfolio of targeted biological therapies and offers the potential to block a fundamental driver of the disease.""

 

He added: ""Following our recent successful launch of a first-in-class biologic for severe asthma in an eosinophilic population, we plan to investigate this asset's potential to treat other targeted populations, for which there are currently no effective medicines.""

323,Investigation claims NHS impeding access to hep-c drugs,An investigation published by The BMJ has claimed that the NHS is 'rationing' Gilead's high priced hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.,http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/investigation_claims_nhs_impeding_access_to_hep-c_drugs_1084138,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 10:10:08 +0100",,"An investigation published by The BMJ has claimed that the NHS is impeding access to Gilead's high priced hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.

In the investigation, researchers from the University of Cambridge, the University of Bath, and The BMJ, conclude that NHS England, unable to budget for broad access to these drugs, tried to alter the outcome of the NICE process, and when it failed, defied NICE's authority by rationing access to them.

""The investigation also exposes key weaknesses in our current system of assessing the value of new therapies and delivering them to patients   and asks, is company pricing to blame?"" the authors said in a statement.""

They add that during the course of the investigation, it has emerged how apparent panic over high prices and affordability led NHS England to deploy many delaying tactics, which succeeded in hampering timely access to these drugs.

Sovaldi and Harvoni, launched in 2014, have been highly controversial because, despite offering cure rates of over 90 percent, their prices range from around $90,000 per patient in the US to almost  35,000 in England. This has sparked a global debate about access to high priced medicines for governments with limited resources.

The report says that for Sovaldi, NHS England spuriously asked for six months to implement guidance (the mandatory 90 days and an additional three months), saying it needed time to set up a proper database to audit patients and usage of the new drugs. NHS England also tried to completely block Harvoni and two other competitor drugs undergoing appraisals at NICE, and questioned the level of clinical evidence.

NICE did eventually succeed in publishing guidance recommending these drugs for the majority of hepatitis C patients, but the authors note that NHS England is not fully following NICE's mandate, which requires that approved drugs are made available within the NHS. Instead it has restricted use of the new drugs by forcing quotas on clinical teams around the country.

They continue: ""This rationing has left many clinicians facing hard decisions and difficult conversations with patients who have already seen their treatments delayed several times. And there is now growing evidence that some frustrated patients are turning to overseas 'buyers' clubs' to source the drugs at their own expense.""

NHS England says its delivery of drugs is entirely within the parameters of the NICE guidance - and highlighted Gilead's pricing as the key reason why treatment was being delayed. This echoes major criticisms of Gilead's pricing strategy in the US, where legislators said the company had adopted a strategy ""designed to maximise revenue with little concern for access or affordability"".

A spokesperson for NHS England said it was ""exploring the potential for a longer term strategic procurement for a supply agreement with the industry to improve the affordability of and access to treatment further"".

The Hepatitis C Trust, a patient advocacy organisation, believes the NHS is risking legal action over its decision to ration them. Chief executive Charles Gore said the Trust has ""already spoken to solicitors to take on any cases that come up, because we are not going to have NHS England pick on a disenfranchised group"".

Andrew Ustianowski, a consultant in infectious diseases at Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, added: ""I think some people in NHS England would love to clip NICE's wings and turn it into a kind of recommendatory rather than mandatory body. And if you are going to choose a fight then choosing this battlefield is quite a sensible thing to do   a marginalised population, very high-cost drugs.""

Dr Ustianowski resigned from NHS England's clinical advisory group, in protest at deliberate attempts to delay access to treatment.

In a statement the company said that it continues to view the UK as an attractive location for investment in advanced manufacturing due to a number of factors including the skilled workforce, technological and scientific capabilities and infrastructure, and a competitive corporate tax system.

GSK specifically singled out the Patent Box, which encourages investment in R&D and related manufacturing in the UK by delivering a lower rate of corporation tax on profits generated from UK-owned intellectual property.

The investment will be split across three sites:  92 million to Barnard Castle in County Durham,  110 million to Montrose in Angus in Scotland, and  74 million to Ware in Hertfordshire.

The company added: ""In addition to jobs associated with the construction of the new facilities, today's announcement will support current employment at these three sites and is expected to lead to the creation of new employment opportunities.""

CEO Andrew Witty said: ""Today's announcement reflects further investment to support our pharmaceutical pipeline and meet growing demand for our innovative portfolio of newly launched products. It is testament to our skilled UK workforce and the country's leading position in life sciences that we are making these investments in advanced manufacturing here. From their manufacture in the UK, many of these medicines will be sent to patients around the world.""

Adrian Tombling, patent attorney and Head of the Life Sciences Group at intellectual property firm, Withers & Rogers, commented:

 

""This is a vote of confidence for the UK economy and demonstrates how much has been achieved to create a fiscal and legislative landscape where companies that invest in innovation can thrive. The introduction of the Patent Box regime in 2013, which allows businesses to pay significantly less corporation tax on any profits they earn from their patented inventions, is viewed as a major benefit to innovative companies and is helping to balance out any Brexit uncertainties. 

 

""From an intellectual property perspective, there is much to play for in the next two years and there is an opportunity to build on the strong commercial proposition that is attracting big businesses like GSK. With the support of industry, we must secure a positive position for Britain that will continue to offer companies in the UK access to pan-European patent and trade mark protection on competitive terms, at the same time as giving them access to other international markets.""",Pharma,Pharma,"large molecule biological drugs,competitive corporate tax system,intellectual property perspective,uk-owned intellectual property,trade mark protection,intellectual property firm,newly launched products,ceo andrew witty,meet growing demand,strong commercial proposition,life sciences group,gsk invests  275m,gsk specifically singled,attracting big businesses,patent box regime,advanced manufacturing due,support current employment,skilled uk workforce,skilled workforce,life sciences,competitive terms,patent box,advanced manufacturing,corporation tax,employment opportunities,pan-european patent,patent attorney,related manufacturing,scientific capabilities,boost production,legislative landscape,barnard castle,adrian tombling,international markets,attractive location,brexit uncertainties,innovative portfolio,pay significantly,positive position,factors including,patented inventions,county durham,withers & rogers,leading position,pharmaceutical pipeline,lower rate,major benefit,support delivery,manufacturing sites,offer companies,innovative companies,uk economy,uk manufacturinggsk,profits generated,announcement reflects,company added,encourages investment,invest  275 million,uk access","The investment will be split across three sites:  92 million to Barnard Castle in County Durham,  110 million to Montrose in Angus in Scotland, and  74 million to Ware in Hertfordshire.

328,Top three therapy areas dominate pipelines,"The world's top three therapy areas accounted for 68 percent of the overall pharmaceutical industry pipeline as of Q1 2016, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research.",http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/top_three_therapy_areas_dominate_pipelines_1082845,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 09:46:23 +0100",,"The world's top three therapy areas accounted for 68 percent of the overall pharmaceutical industry pipeline as of Q1 2016, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research.

The company's Innovation Tracking Factbook 2016 states that oncology is by far the largest therapy area, with almost 7,000 products in active development, almost matching the combined size of the next two therapy areas, infectious diseases and central nervous system disorders, which each have over 3,000 products in active development.

However, there is a great deal of pipeline activity in the next few therapy areas, with immunology, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases each having pipelines consisting of over 1,000 products.

Dominic Trewartha, Managing Analyst for GBI Research, says: ""The pipelines in these therapy areas are the largest because they have substantial patient populations and strong unmet needs within the indications that account for the majority of patients in each area.

""Oncology is a rapidly growing therapy area, in terms of both me-too and first-in-class oncology products. This growth was generally substantial in Q1 2016, with the largest three indications in terms of the number of products   namely breast, lung and colorectal cancer   each exhibiting pipeline growth in excess of 15 percent.""

GBI Research's report also notes that the overall pharmaceutical industry pipeline increased by 5 percent in Q1 2016. This trend generally holds true across all therapy areas, with only CNS disorders and immunology having marginally decreased in size. The most rapid growth was witnessed in the smallest therapy areas, led by women's health, which grew by 55 percent in Q1 2016.

These much needed points of clarification help inform pharma and biotech companies on how to best create and maintain an eTMF system.

Mapping And Tracking Your Route to an eTMF

It requires a considerable amount of effort and money to implement an eTMF system. This coupled with the multiple complications with implementation, inevitably means that solid aims, goals and objectives are vital for success. Examples of key objectives, which support the existence of an eTMF as well as guiding optimal maintenance, include:

 Maintaining TMF transparency: In the face of different studies featuring a range of compounds which will cause TMFs to vary from case to case sponsors and CROs should aim to maintain astandardised level of TMF knowledge and transparency throughout each and every study.

Process implementation and adaptability. Finding the right process for your company and utilising this method to the best of its ability using an outsourced system. Third party eTMF systems may cause this to become prominent and will demand theadaptation and introduction of new  processes where required.

It s important to ensure that the team is willing to adapt to the new process for the eTMF, which might not occur naturally. Training is going to be a likelynecessity for a handful of people within  the business.

 Maintaining TMF inspection readiness at all times: Complying to relevant regulatory guidelines   including theICH GCP. View our infographic on being inspection ready here

Depending on the filing structure, the transference to an eTMF can be straightforward. Although, if amends are made to the filing structure in parallel to the transference to an eTMF, a lot of confusion can be encountered as this creates a huge migration project.

Key management metrics: This is useful for the maintenance of an eTMF system and can be more involved than with paper format. With paper it is fairly straightforward   a person could pull out the binders, review timelines and apply their knowledge to define a status with a TMF.

The measurement of TMF s quality is vital, using either QC or QA measures. To do this for any eTMF programme one needs the right tools and processes to monitor progress, quality and archiving procedures. Close internal collaboration will be required to devise the certain stages for this.

Increasing and maintaining a high level of eTMF quality throughout all studies.

One of the downfalls  to the implementation of an eTMF is the expense required. In comparison to  a paper TMF, it costs considerably more to   Implement an eTMF study,especially with a debut eTMF study. There are various updated directives focusing tightly on eTMF, like the ICH GCP addendum. As part of the implementation process consultants may be required to review and realign internal processes to ensure everything is compliant and effective, which will require funding.",Pharma,Pharma,"relevant regulatory guidelines   including theich gcp,updated information providing giving insight,electronic trial master file,interoperable e-tmf systemthe transition,updated directives focusing tightly,pharma & biotech resourcesthe transition,maintaining tmf inspection readiness,ich gcp addendum,close internal collaboration,huge migration project,interoperable e-tmf system,key management metrics,guiding optimal maintenance,party etmf systems,realign internal processes,maintain astandardised level,debut etmf study,maintaining tmf transparency,implementation process consultants,inform pharma,inspection ready,biotech companies,high level,filing structure,considerable amount,monitor progress,partially solved,construction alongside,inevitably means,varying views,archiving procedures,multiple complications,significant task,require funding,solid aims,opinions complicating,costs considerably,qa measures,reviewing behaviours,occur naturally,demand theadaptation,key objectives,pharmaceuticals & biotechnology,needed points,outsourced system,etmf programme,cost effective,etmf study,etmf system,process implementation,case sponsors,review timelines,studies featuring,fairly straightforward,paper format,tmf knowledge,paper tmf,expense required,etmf quality,maintaining,study,maintenance,transparency,directives,maintain,tmf,system,implementation,process","Implementing a cost effective and interoperable e-TMF systemThe transition from paper to electronic Trial Master File (TMF) system, is a significant task, which is further complicated with the varying views and opinions complicating the route to standardisation.

By having complete visibility on how far away the reality of an airtight Trial Master File is, this provides the pharma firm with an opportunity to alter the project strajectory if needed. This transparency can be preserved via a range of avenues which include having: solid metrics, clear oversight, frequent exchanges with the CRO and accurate understanding of the required documents.

In commissioning a CRO to manage a clinical trial, according to EU regulations the pharma or biotech firm is still responsible for the trial and so they need to retain complete oversight. Inevitably, a sponsor s access to the TMF will be required, which is simplified by the electronic format. The sponsor will also have to decide what proofing needs to be sent by the CRO, so they can ensure the required level of documentation is obtained. Sponsor representatives need to at any given point have an awareness of the project s progress and its level of quality. UK  regulatory body MHRA clarifies that this should stretch to the presence of guidance in the organization to assist the Chief Investigator in maintaining the files via audits. The body added that outsourced workers can be held accountable with oversight documents and plans held by the sponsor s governance department.

In Pharma IQ s 2015 industry research, the effective management of CRO interactions   was voted as the predominant focus for the following 12 months.When outlining an oversight strategy it is wise to establish the CRO s awareness of their responsibilities at the start of the project. This also provides a good opportunity to finalise aspects like how often documents should be uploaded, QC checks and oversight guidelines for the sponsor.

An e-tmf system, coupled with quality metrics that enable the collation of special overview reports, can provide a dashboard view to a sponsor so they can fully grasp the status of the TMF. This can reveal for example how many of the file s 10,000 documents received spot checks from the CRO and what findings have been uncovered.",Pharma,Pharma,"uk  regulatory body mhra clarifies,trial master file transparencyin striving,airtight trial master file,fartrial master file transparency,pharma & biotech resourcesin striving,000 documents received spot checks,special overview reports,inspection ready tmf,retain complete oversight,body added,qc checks,clinical trial,biotech firm,complete visibility,oversight guidelines,clear oversight,oversight strategy,oversight documents,multiple parties,solid grasp,outsourced workers,accurate understanding,chief investigator,effective management,plans held,solid metrics,eu regulations,electronic format,finalise aspects,legal responsibility,predominant focus,e-tmf system,fully grasp,held accountable,governance department,dashboard view,pharmaceuticals & biotechnology,frequent exchanges,2015 industry research,pharma iq,pharma firm,actual status,good opportunity,required documents,quality metrics,project strajectory,sponsor representatives,cro interactions,required level,trial","By having complete visibility on how farTrial Master File Transparency | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesIn striving towards having an inspection ready TMF, which comprises of thousands of documents and in most cases the work of multiple parties, it is the legal responsibility of a pharma or biotech firm to have a solid grasp on the actual status of the file.

This harsh dismissal, the signature line of an old TV game show, seemed all the harsher for being delivered in the spotlight s glare. Such directness seemed excessive when it was used to eject hapless game-show contestants, but it may be just enough in biotechnology, where a light-activated means of removing protein linker sequences or protein introns, or inteins could lead to more powerful pharmaceuticals.

In a protein, the  weakest link  can be an extra sequence that disrupts the protein s function. Such sequences, according to research from the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI), can be removed by a system newly discovered in the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. BTI researchers have shown that chloroplast extracts from C. reinhardtii can accomplish the light-activated removal of interrupting sequences from at least one protein. The researchers anticipate that factors from the extracts could be modified for general use in biotechnology.

BCI scientists Stephen Campbell and David Stern discovered this new repair system while purifying a protein from the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii that can cut RNA. Upon sequencing the protein, he identified it as RB47, a protein that was not known to have any RNA-cleaving ability. Dr. Campbell noticed that the middle of the protein was missing. When he compared the protein sequence to its corresponding gene sequence, the protein was much shorter than expected.

Upon further study, Dr. Campbell found that he could detect a long version of the protein that contained an insertion and a short version that didn't. The cells make both versions when grown in the light or the dark, but only the short version can cleave RNA. The long version of the protein could be converted into the short one by mixing it in a test tube with chloroplasts from cells grown in the light and by illuminating the reaction. This process removed the interrupting insertion and restored the RNA-cutting activity of the protein. It is likely that the chloroplast maintains the machinery necessary to remove the sequence so that it can restore functionality to the protein.

Details of the work appeared in the July 29 issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry, in an article entitled,  Activation of an Endoribonuclease by Non-intein Protein Splicing.  The article described how epitope tags and protein sequencing were used to demonstrate that a nonconserved sequence in the was excised from a full-length version of the RB47 protein, and that the flanking sequences were spliced together.

 The requirement for endogenous factors and light differentiates this protein splicing from autocatalytic inteins, and may allow the chloroplast to regulate the activation of RB47 endoribonuclease activity,  wrote the article s authors.  We speculate that this protein splicing activity arose to post-translationally repair proteins that had been inactivated by deleterious insertions or extensions. 

Because the insertion can be placed so that it interrupts a protein's function, the insertion and repair system may be useful for producing certain pharmaceuticals or protein products such as cancer drugs in culture that would otherwise kill the cell. After purification, the inactive products could be treated with chloroplast factors and light to remove the insertion and activate the proteins.

In future work, the researchers plan to investigate exactly how the insertion becomes spliced out of the protein and which plant factors facilitate its removal. They also aim to understand the purpose of the insertion, and whether the algae can control the splicing to respond to changes in the environment.

Campbell and Stern also want to know how widespread this new type of protein splicing might be.

""If it is happening in plants, is it happening in animals?"" said Stern.

343,Single Protein Protects against Neurodegenerative Diseases,"

The researchers are hopeful that the results from this new study will provide needed insight into the biochemical pathways that mediate toxic protein removal and shield the body from disease.

Protein clumps occur as part of the natural aging process, but they are regularly detangled and disposed of as a result of the gene called UBQLN2. However, when this gene mutates, or becomes faulty, it can no longer help the cell to remove these toxic protein clumps, which leads to neurodegenerative disease. In the current study, the researchers utilized an array of cell biology and biochemistry methods, as well as sophisticated mouse models to uncover the primary functions of UBQLN2 detangling clumps, then shredding them to prevent future tangles.

 The function of UBQNL2 is connected to many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson s, Alzheimer s, and Huntington s diseases,  explained senior study author Thimo Kurz, Ph.D., senior lecturer at the Institute of Molecular, Cell, and Systems Biology within the University of Glasgow.  These patients often have very clear clumps in their brain cells. Using mice that mimic human Huntington s disease, we found that when UBQLN2 is mutated, it could no longer help nerve cells to remove protein clumps in the brains of these mice. 

Previous work has shown that when the UBQLN2 gene is faulty, it leads to a neurodegenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD, or motor neuron disease with dementia). However, until this study, it was not fully understood why mutation of this gene caused disease.

 We describe a new pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis mediated by the proteasome shuttle factor UBQLN2,  the authors wrote.  The 26S proteasome degrades polyubiquitylated substrates by recognizing them through stoichiometrically bound ubiquitin receptors, but substrates are also delivered by reversibly bound shuttles. We aimed to determine why these parallel delivery mechanisms exist and found that UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. 

The findings from this study were published recently in Cell in an article entitled  UBQLN2 Mediates Autophagy-Independent Protein Aggregate Clearance by the Proteasome. 

The authors continued, stating that  UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act. Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice. 

This research sheds light on the specific mechanisms of UBQLN2 activity, but stil leaves open the question of why mutations in this gene are so detrimental to the body. The scientists are hopeful that their findings will pave the way for new research into novel treatment options for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

 The significance of this discovery goes beyond the role of UBQLN2 in motor-neuron disease with dementia,  noted lead study author Roland Hjerpe, Ph.D., research associate at the Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology.  Our study has revealed a new mechanism by which nerve cells cope with protein clumps in general, which has implications for most neurodegenerative diseases and can open up avenues for new therapeutic interventions to treat these conditions in the future.

Data from the other endpoints of ENDEAR will be analyzed when the full data set is available, with results to be presented at future medical congresses, the companies said.

Participants enrolled in the sham-controlled arm of EMBRACE, a Phase II study that also included infantile-onset patients, will have the opportunity to receive nusinersen, Biogen and Ionis said. Other studies in the nusinersen program, including CHERISH (later-onset consistent with Type 2) and NURTURE (presymptomatic infants), will continue as planned.

 We remain committed to understanding the potential of nusinersen in the broader SMA population and will continue to focus on the rapid completion of our ongoing studies,  Alfred Sandrock, M.D., Ph.D., Biogen evp and CMO, said in a statement.  We share the community s sense of urgency as we strive to bring the first treatment for SMA, the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, to families facing this devastating disease. 

To that end, Biogen said it is working to open a global expanded-access program (EAP) for eligible patients with infantile-onset SMA (consistent with Type 1) in coming months. Once the EAP is operational and required local approvals are in place, individual participating trial sites may start enrollment after they have transitioned ENDEAR study participants to the open-label extension study.

Biogen has paid Ionis a $75 million license fee after exercising its option to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. Biogen is now responsible for all nusinersen development, regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs, while Ionis will complete the Phase III studies and work with Biogen on regulatory filings.

The two companies said they will also work together to transition the clinical programs that Ionis is conducting to Biogen. In addition to the license fee, Ionis could receive tiered royalties on potential sales of nusineren up to a percentage in the mid-teens, in addition to up to $150 million in milestone payments based on regulatory approvals.

The companies had partnered on nusinersen for SMA one of several collaborations by the companies since 2012, when Ionis was known as Isis Pharmaceuticals and the SMA candidate was called ISIS-SMN

Since 2012, GSK said, it has been active in bioelectronic medicine, which aims to fight chronic diseases through miniaturized, implantable devices capable of modifying electrical signals that pass along nerves in the body. Those signals include the irregular or altered impulses occurring in many illnesses.

GSK said it has created a global network of around 50 research collaborations and invested $50 million in a dedicated bioelectronics venture capital fund. The pharma giant reasons that bioelectronics medicines can potentially treat arthritis, diabetes, and asthma.

Those chronic diseases mesh with three of GSK s 12 key therapeutic areas of interest immunoinflammation, metabolic/cardiovascular, and respiratory with bioelectronics R&D identified as a fourth.

Galvani is designed to combine GSK s drug discovery and development expertise and knowledge of disease biology with Verily s technical expertise in the miniaturization of low-power electronics, device development, data analytics, and software development for clinical applications.

Initial work at Galvani will focus on establishing clinical proofs of principle in inflammatory, metabolic, and endocrine disorders including type 2 diabetes, where GSK said  substantial  evidence already exists in animal models as well as developing associated miniaturized, precision devices.

Galvani will be headquartered within GSK s global R&D center at Stevenage, U.K., with a second research hub at the South San Francisco, CA, facilities of Verily, the life sciences division of Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Soon after the announcement of Alphabet s creation last year, a Google spokesperson told GEN that  Diabetes is a major focus area for the life sciences team at Google as we become a standalone company.  The company has combined its miniaturized electronics platform with Dexcom s sensor technology to develop next-generation versions of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).

GSK said the new company will initially employ around 30 scientists, engineers, and clinicians and will fund and integrate a broad range of collaborations with both parent companies, academia, and other R&D companies.

 This agreement with Verily to establish Galvani Bioelectronics signals a crucial step forward in GSK s bioelectronics journey, bringing together health and tech to realize a shared vision of miniaturized, precision electrical therapies,  Moncef Slaoui, GSK s Chairman of Global Vaccines, said in a statement.  If successful, this approach offers the potential for a new therapeutic modality alongside traditional medicines and vaccines. 

Slaoui has spearheaded GSK s investments in bioelectronics, and will chair Galvani s seven-member board, whose members will include Verily CEO Andy Conrad, Ph.D.

Kris Famm, GSK s vp of bioelectronics R&D, has been appointed president of Galvani.

In this way, the system could ultimately be carried onto the battlefield and used to produce treatments at the point of care. It could also be used to manufacture a vaccine to prevent a disease outbreak in a remote village, according to senior author Tim Lu, Ph.D., an associate professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science, and head of the Synthetic Biology Group at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics.

""Imagine you were on Mars or in a remote desert, without access to a full formulary; you could program the yeast to produce drugs on demand locally,"" Dr. Lu says.

The system is based on a programmable strain of yeast, Pichia pastoris, which can be induced to express one of two therapeutic proteins when exposed to a particular chemical trigger. The researchers chose P. pastoris because it can grow to high densities on simple and inexpensive carbon sources and is able to express large amounts of protein.

""We altered the yeast so it could be more easily genetically modified, and could include more than one therapeutic in its repertoire,"" notes Dr. Lu.

When the researchers exposed the modified yeast to estrogen  -estradiol, the cells expressed recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH). In contrast, when they exposed the cells to methanol, the yeast expressed the protein interferon. The cells are held within a millimeter-scale tabletop microbioreactor, containing a microfluidic chip, which was originally developed by Rajeev Ram, Ph.D., a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, and his team, and then commercialized by Kevin Lee,  an MIT graduate and co-author, through a spin-off company.

A liquid containing the desired chemical trigger is first fed into the reactor, to mix with the cells. Inside the reactor, the cell-and-chemical mixture is surrounded on three sides by polycarbonate; on the fourth side is a flexible and gas-permeable silicone rubber membrane. By pressurizing the gas above this membrane, the researchers are able to gently massage the liquid droplet to ensure its contents are fully mixed together.

""This makes sure that the one milliliter (of liquid) is homogeneous, and that is important because diffusion at these small scales, where there is no turbulence, takes a surprisingly long time,"" says Dr. Ram, who was also a senior author of the paper.

Because the membrane is gas permeable, it allows oxygen to flow through to the cells, while any carbon dioxide they produce can be easily extracted. The device continuously monitors conditions within the microfluidic chip, including oxygen levels, temperature, and pH, to ensure the optimum environment for cell growth. It also monitors cell density.

If the yeast is required to produce a different protein, the liquid is simply flushed through a filter, leaving the cells behind. Fresh liquid containing a new chemical trigger can then be added, to stimulate production of the next protein.

Although other research teams have previously attempted to build microbioreactors, these have not have not had the ability to retain the protein-producing cells while flushing out the liquid they are mixed with, according to Dr. Ram. ""You want to keep the cells because they are your factory,"" he says. ""But you also want to rapidly change their chemical environment, in order to change the trigger for protein production.""

The researchers are now investigating the use of the system in combinatorial treatments, in which multiple therapeutics, such as antibodies, are used together. Combining multiple therapeutics in this way can be expensive if each requires its own production line, explains Dr. Lu.

""But if you could engineer a single strain, or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost,"" he says.",Pharma,Pharma,"symit team develops portable drug production system,mit team develops portable drug production system,cells expressed recombinant human growth hormone,defense advanced research projects agency,portable production system designed,device continuously monitors conditions,gas-permeable silicone rubber membrane,senior author tim lu,monitors cell density,surprisingly long time,inexpensive carbon sources,millimeter-scale tabletop microbioreactor,combining multiple therapeutics,including oxygen levels,easily genetically modified,express large amounts,synthetic biology group,desired chemical trigger,senior author,cell growth,stimulate production,programmable production,production line,research laboratory,research teams,yeast expressed,team,multiple therapeutics,protein production,synthetic biology,compact device,easily extracted,carbon dioxide,microbioreactor platforms,chemical trigger,chemical environment,mit graduate,single dose,build microbioreactors,remote desert,disease outbreak,fourth side,gently massage,full formulary,simply flushed,high densities,optimum environment,previously attempted,small droplet,news highlightsscientists,combinatorial treatments,microfluidic chip,reasonable cost,kevin lee,small scales,programmable strain,single strain,electrical engineering,biological engineering,nature communications,estrogen  -estradiol,computer science,cell-and-chemical mixture,remote village,modified yeast,researchers chose,associate professor,researchers demonstrate,protein-producing cells,therapeutic proteins,rapidly change,fully mixed,pichia pastoris,gas permeable,produce treatments,notes dr,explains dr,protein interferon,originally developed,demand locally,rajeev ram,fresh liquid,liquid droplet,manufacture combinations","In a paper (&quot;Synthetic Biology and Microbioreactor Platforms for Programmable Production of Biologics at the Point-of-Care&quot;) published in Nature Communications, the researchers demonstrate that the system can be used to produce a single dose of treatment from a compact device containing a small droplet of cells in a liquid.

350,The Ally Within the Enemy Within," 
	If cancer cells were capable of understanding the phrase, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re your own worst enemy,&rdquo; they wouldn&rsquo;t think it applied to them. Yet cancer cells can be made to subvert themselves, as Tocagen, a cancer-selective gene therapy company, has demonstrated. Tocagen has developed a way to instigate cooperation between cancer and the immune system, an entity cancer ordinarily shirks or shuns. 
 
	Tocagen utilizes retroviral replicating vectors (RRVs) that are designed to selectively deliver therapeutic genes to cancer cells. The RRVs ensure that the genes integrate into the DNA of dividing cancer cells, which then serve as a factory for producing additional RRVs, which spread to neighboring cancer cells. 
 
	So far, so straightforward. But the inserted genes have a twist. They cause the cancer cells to secrete an enzyme that converts a prodrug that kills not only additional cancer cells, but also immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. A brake is taken off the imm",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/the-ally-within-the-enemy-within/5806/,,,"The Ally Within the Enemy Within | Magazine ArticlesTocagen calls its conditionally lytic viral approach to cancer therapy Toca 511 & Toca FC. It is being investigated initially for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. In a Phase I trial against high-grade glioma, Toca 511 & Toca FC has increased the probability of two-year survival to 40% and doubled survival from about 7 months to about 14 months, compared to an external control.

 Our approach uses replicating, nonpathogenic, retroviral vectors to deliver the gene cytosine deaminase (CD) to actively dividing cells,  says Harry Gruber, M.D., Tocagen s president and CEO.  Even with tumor antigen drift, the therapy is designed to continue to work. 

Gene delivery, the first step of the therapy, is accomplished by Toca 511, an injectable RRV that encodes CD, a prodrug activator enzyme. The replicating virus can be delivered intravenously (even for patients with high-grade glioma) or directly to tumor cells. It then spreads through the tumor by budding and cell-to-cell contact, programming other cells to make CD and providing a long-term presence of the therapeutic gene.

During the second step of the therapy, patients take a proprietary tablet called Toca FC for one week. The CD converts this extended-release form of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into an approved drug called 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that kills cancer cells and, importantly, immunosuppressive myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that would otherwise survive to help tumor cells evade the immune system.

 Unlike classical oncolytic viruses, our virus can first stealthily spread through a tumor before inducing killing via the prodrug,  explains Dr. Gruber.  This illustrates the importance of the virus being conditionally lytic. 

This approach of creating 5-FU directly in the tumor microenvironment eliminates the side effects to healthy tissue that have limited its conventional systemic use. And as cancer cells die, they release tumor-associated antigens (including neoantigens) and denatured viral proteins that further activate immune cells to target cancer.

 The half-life of 5-FU, the active drug, is very short. It s measured in minutes,  Dr. Gruber notes. The treatment cycle with Toca FC is repeated at approximately six-week intervals.  Each cycle,  he adds,  may reactivate the immune system against the body s own cancer. 

A subset of 27 high-grade glioma patients received higher dosages. For this subset, there was a 40% probability of survival at 24 months, and median survival was 14.4 months more than double that of an external matched control group of patients receiving the current standard of care (the chemotherapy drug lomustine).  We re seeing patients with complete tumor regression that has lasted over one year, and others with marked tumor shrinkage,  reports Dr. Gruber.

Tocagen is recruiting patients with recurrent glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma for a Phase II/III trial, called Toca 5, in the United States and Canada. Enrollment is expected to close around the end of 2016.

351,Microbial Platforms Set for Rapid Growth," 
	 Benefits of microbial fermentation have   stirred debate about it potentially overtak ing mammalian processing. But the debate is  more froth than substance. Microbial plat forms won&rsquo;t displace mammalian platforms anytime soon. 
 
	 Microbial manufacturing is a critical part of the protein-expression industry mix, and it will remain so, particularly since the microbial side is growing. In fact, the microbial side is projected to grow even faster than the mam  malian side in the coming years, although it   should be pointed out that the microbial side is starting from a lower base.  
 
	Microbial manufacturing is growing because it presents certain advantages over mammalian processing. The main advantage is that microbial manufacturing is generally c",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/microbial-platforms-set-for-rapid-growth/5807/,,,"Microbial Platforms Set for Rapid Growth | Magazine ArticlesAnother factor tending to inhibit growth in microbial usage, at least in the United States, is the concentration of microbial capacity in Europe. For example, most large-scale GMP-capable contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) reside in Europe. Meanwhile, GMP-capable CMOs in the United States lack sufficient microbial manufacturing capacity at over 100 L scales. Also, only recently have single-use microbial bioreactors started to enter the market.

Worldwide, there appears to be no shortage of microbial manufacturing capacity, and more capacity is being installed. According to a global survey conducted this year by BioPlan Associates, the biopharmaceutical industry maintains about 1,800 good-sized microbial bioreactors ( 100 L), including nearly 500 bioreactors near the higher-end ( 2,000 L).

These numbers come from BioPlan Associates  13th Annual Report and Survey of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Capacity and Production, the most recent study of biotherapeutic developers and contract manufacturing organizations  current and projected future capacity and production. This report, which summarizes information from 222 bioprocessing professionals, indicates that overall microbial bioreactor capacity utilization (in terms of the percentage of operating capacity used) is 50.0%. In comparison, mammalian capacity utilization is higher, at 74.7%.

There appears to be no near-term microbial  capacity crunch.  Further, only 45.2% of respondents perform all their microbial production in-house, with most doing some outsourcing to CMOs.

Additional insights come from a quick powers-of-ten review of the survey s numbers for production capacity. Of the survey s respondents, 17.1% indicate that they maintain capacity below 100 L; 20%, from 100 to 999 L, 40%, from 1,000 to 9,999 L; and 22.9%, equal to and above 10,000 L. When the last three ranges are combined, it becomes apparent that 82.9% of respondents have capacity  100 L, sufficient for manufacture of most preclinical and early trial supplies. Also, it is notable that the largest portion of respondents, 40%, reported capacities in the 1,000 to 9,999 L range.

A closer look (Figure 1) reveals that 34.2% of respondents reported capacities of less than 500 L, a significant increase from 13.1% last year. The data suggest facilities have been adding bioreactors in the  500 L range.

352,Stem Cells and the Frozen Zoo," 
	Pluripotent stem cells are having a tremendous impact on medical research, improving the&nbsp;biological relevance of drug screens and potentially providing effective cell-replacement therapies&nbsp;for degenerative diseases. But the regenerative properties of stem cells also make them useful for more unusual purposes, specifically, to improve conservation of endangered animal species. &nbsp; 
 
	This perspective explains how I got involved with conservation research and how the idea of stem cells being used to rescue animals under threat of extinction has caught the attention of a different sort of institution: zoos. 
 
	In late 2007, my lab moved from the Burnham Institute (now Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) to The Scripps Research Institute. It was a journey of only a couple of blocks, but nevertheless it had many moments of drama, and we were all tired. I decided to reward my lab members (and me) with a trip to one of my favorite places&mdash;the San Diego Zoo Safari Pa",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/stem-cells-and-the-frozen-zoo/5808/,,,"Stem Cells and the Frozen Zoo | Magazine ArticlesThis meeting (Conservation by Cellular Technologies) was organized by representatives from several zoos, and brought together scientists from four continents to plan a rescue plan for the northern white rhino. A report in the journal Zoo Biology,  Rewinding the Process of Mammalian Extinction , authored by all 21 attendees at the meeting, outlines the roadmap we developed for rescue of this nearly extinct species (Zoo Biol. published online May 2, 2016).

The reason that this meeting and the publication are so remarkable is illustrated by the diversity of the scientific expertise in the room. Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun and I represented one end of the spectrum of knowledge; our part of the plan is to reprogram and characterize all 12 individual animals whose fibroblasts are stored in The Frozen Zoo.

A scientist from Japan provided expertise for the next step in the roadmap, the generation of functional gametes from the iPSCs. This has been done with mouse PSCs, but the methods are still under development and haven t yet been tested in any other species. The rest of the roadmap, culminating with the birth of a rhino calf, was filled in by scientists who clone large animals, experts in the reproductive physiology of rhinos, and the San Diego Zoo itself, which has already brought in 6 healthy females from the closely related southern white rhino species who will serve as surrogate mothers if the team s work results in production of rhino embryos.

Does this plan have any chance of succeeding? I know it will be difficult, but I think it s not impossible. Perhaps the most important advance is that such a diverse group agreed on a plan it wasn t just a stem cell biologist like me imagining how the cells might be used, but rather a whole chain of experts who can imagine how to accomplish each step.

This means that an aspiration of the group, that our strategy could be adopted for other species, might be feasible. I m optimistic about this possibility. Just last week I was invited to a meeting at the San Diego Zoo to discuss possible options for a long-term rescue of the black-footed ferret, a native of the U.S. West. Other than Oliver Ryder and me, the group was a completely different assortment of scientists and policy experts.  Although the animal and the challenges are different, the general roadmap that we developed for the rhino might apply to the ferret as well.

There are many arguments against launching a complex project like the rhino rescue program. Some say that the money is wasted unless it is used to restore the habitat that has been destroyed by humans. Others see no purpose in rescuing an animal that will be confined to zoos because of poaching.  Finding funding for this rescue approach is a major challenge my lab s step is the simplest: now that we know we can make iPSCs, I can accurately gauge the costs. We will need to raise funding at every step, and the sources of such support are not clear.

We chose the northern white rhino because of our history and special fondness for these animals that humans are responsible for killing. But perhaps another animal would better serve as proof of principle. But we ve taken the first step: a large change in direction like this requires that the people involved agree with the change.

353,Quantifying the Potency of Cancer Immunotherapies," 
	The high specificity and potent cytotoxicity of innate and adaptive immune system effector cells make them promising agents for extirpating cancer cells or, at the very least, controlling disease progression. Though the list of cell- and antibody-mediated cancer immunotherapies is growing, many of these are efficacious for only a subset of patients.&nbsp; 
 
	Realizing the full therapeutic potential of this field will require: (1) continued elucidation of the mechanisms underlying cancer cell recognition and immune cell-mediated killing, and (2) an ability to screen immunotherapy constructs/conditions (CARTs, checkpoint inhibitors, etc.) using patient-derived effector and/or target cells to identify optimal treatment regimens (i.e. theranostics). 
 
	Fundamental to both of the above is the ability to quantitatively monitor the potency of immunotherapy-mediated killing of target cells under controlled conditions in vitro.&nbsp; Traditional cell killing assays suffer from drawbacks that prevent t",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/quantifying-the-potency-of-cancer-immunotherapies/5809/,,,"Quantifying the Potency of Cancer Immunotherapies | Magazine ArticlesWith dozens of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, the utility of xCELLigence RTCA for probing the efficacy of immunotherapies targeting solid/adherent cancers is now firmly established.  However, ~10% of all cancers are liquid in nature, are therefore nonadherent, and cannot be directly monitored by the standard impedance assay.

Moreover, because they are readily accessible within the bloodstream and aren t confounded by the microenvironment complexities/heterogeneities associated with solid tumors, liquid cancers (B cell cancers in particular) are prominent immunotherapy targets at present. To help accelerate research in this area, ACEA recently developed an xCELLigence Immunotherapy Kit focused on B cell killing.

For this purpose, the wells of ACEA s electronic microtiter plate are precoated with a B cell-specific antibody, enabling B cells to be immobilized on the plate bottom (Figure 3A). Whereas antibody immobilized B cells generate a robust impedance signal and proliferate to the point of confluence (resulting in a plateaued impedance signal), the growth of untethered B cells is essentially undetectable (Figure 3B). Importantly, with or without antibody coating of the wells effector cells, such as the NK-92 cells used here, produce minimal signal on their own (Figure 3B).

Addition of NK-92 cells on top of immobilized B cells results in target cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C).  The tethering and killing behaviors seen in Figures 3B & 3C have been observed in all three of the B cell lines tested (Daudi, Raji, and Ramos), for multiple effector cell types (NK, T, CART), and for combination therapies (CART + checkpoint inhibitors, etc.).

An important question is whether the physical immobilization of B cells via antibody tethering affects the efficiency with which they are killed. To assess this, side-by-side four hour assays were performed for NK-92 cell-mediated killing of Raji B cells that were either immobilized (analyzed by xCELLigence) or in suspension (analyzed by flow cytometry). As seen in Figure 3D, the killing trends observed by these two methods correlate perfectly, with the magnitude of % cytolysis varying minimally. This is consistent with a large number of publications showing that xCELLigence data consistently recapitulates data obtained by traditional assays.",Pharma,Pharma,"xcelligence data consistently recapitulates data obtained,adaptive immune system effector cells make,mechanisms underlying cancer cell recognition,traditional cell killing assays suffer,identify optimal treatment regimens,multiple effector cell types,xcelligence immunotherapy kit focused,immunotherapies targeting solid/adherent cancers,cart + checkpoint inhibitors,immune cell-mediated killing,cell lines tested,prominent immunotherapy targets,screen immunotherapy constructs/conditions,plateaued impedance signal,methods correlate perfectly,robust impedance signal,magazine articleswith dozens,controlling disease progression,produce minimal signal,% cytolysis varying minimally,standard impedance assay,full therapeutic potential,peer-reviewed studies published,target cell death,antibody-mediated cancer immunotherapies,electronic microtiter plate,nk-92 cell-mediated killing,extirpating cancer cells,acea recently developed,wells effector cells,killing trends observed,figures 3b & 3c,antibody tethering affects,traditional assays,cell killing,checkpoint inhibitors,cancer immunotherapies,patient-derived effector,cell cancers,xcelligence rtca,hour assays,immunotherapy-mediated killing,killing behaviors,figure 3c,plate bottom,nk-92 cells,target cells,figure 3b,antibody coating,cell-specific antibody,cells generate,cells results,combination therapies,prevent tquantifying,figure 3a,accelerate research,continued elucidation,high specificity,flow cytometry,quantitatively monitor,dose-dependent manner,important question,essentially undetectable,microenvironment complexities/heterogeneities,solid tumors","To help accelerate research in this area, ACEA recently developed an xCELLigence Immunotherapy Kit focused on B cell killing.

354,Development of a Homogeneous RSV Neutralization Assay," 
	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a syncytial virus that can cause serious respiratory tract infections, especially in infants and young children. 1  To date there is no licensed vaccine against RSV infection and the only preventive treatment option is the neutralizing antibody palivizumab, which is given to high-risk infants by passive administration. 2  Therefore there is a strong drive to identify novel RSV-neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic/preventative applications. 
 
	Here we present the development and implementation of a simple RSV-neutralization assay on TTP Labtech&rsquo;s mirrorball fluorescence cytometer. Compared to established  virus neutralization assays, this method of fers several distinct advantages: 
 
	 
		Homogeneous, no-wash protocol captures data from adherent and detached cells 
	 
		Cells and virus remain safely contained within the assay plate with mirrorball&rsquo;s laser scanning app",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/development-of-a-homogeneous-rsv-neutralization-assay/5810/,,,"Development of a Homogeneous RSV Neutralization Assay | Magazine ArticlesThe neutralization of RSV before exposure to HEp-2 cells was assessed by a homogeneous immunofluorescence assay in 384-well plates. Whole-well images (Figure 2) immediately highlight that the number of RSV-infected green fluorescent cells increases with decreasing concentration of the neutralizing antibody. This increase is accompanied by a change in cell morphology: whereas the noninfected cells grow as a disperse monolayer with distinct nuclei for each cell, the infected cells show clear signs of multinucleation (syncytia formation), one of the hallmarks of RSV infection.3

Several readouts may be used to quantify RSV infection.

By considering the total fluorescence intensity of cells in the green channel (FL-2), the total number of infected cells can be estimated.

The concentration-response curve (Figure 3A) shows a good fit to the datapoints at high concentrations of the neutralizing antibody.  However, the fit is less representative at lower concentrations. At the lowest concentration of the neutralizing antibody there appears to be a decrease in the number of infected cells. In isolation, this result would suggest that the assay was unreliable; however this is not the case.

He saw that a minority of cells derived from a single clone showed marked phenotypic hetoergeneity.

357,GEN Roundup: Context-Enriched Cell-Based Assays," 
	Cells are miniature laboratories that allow scientists to study key biological processes.&nbsp;As a result, they may provide a more natural way to assess the in vivo effects of drugs. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global cell-based assays market is expected to reach over $18 billion by 2020, from almost $11 billion in 2015. 
 
	GEN wanted to know about some of the challenges associated with the use of cell-based assays in high-throughput drug discovery and why these types of assays might be&nbsp;especially appropriate for precision medicine. So we decided to talk to some experts&nbsp;on the topic. ",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/gen-roundup-context-enriched-cell-based-assays/5813/,,,"Context-Enriched Cell-Based Assays | Magazine ArticlesDr. Ferrick: Cell-based assays are considered a critical component of the golden era of drug discovery. With a return to the relevancy of living cells, also comes the fear of  black box  science, potentially leading to drugs that may not be fully adjudicated for efficacy and safety. Fortunately, today s biological toolbox enables the better measurement and replication of human disease characteristics in the laboratory.

Cell-based assays are now able to measure and monitor multiple cellular pathways in real time, incorporate the preferred biological context for screening, and report phenotypic changes more reliably and with improved insight. Additionally, 3D cell cultures, microtissues, embryonic stem cell-derived cultures, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures are now able to better mimic the cell phenotype and microenvironment at the appropriate throughput levels.

Dr. Held: In cell-based assays, it is frequently necessary to control for environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and gas composition (CO and O ) in order to maintain relevant physiological conditions. Also, assays can be lengthy, lasting days rather than hours, necessitating media exchanges or reagent additions at timed intervals. During these operations, assays must be kept free of bacterial contamination.

Such challenges have been addressed primarily with instrumentation and automation. Incubators, which maintain environmental conditions, can have built-in robotics to move microplates to and from liquid handlers and reader/imager devices to automate lengthy assay processes. Reagent additions or media exchanges are performed with liquid handlers, whereas detection (image based or quantitative) is carried out with a microplate reader. These systems are small enough to fit inside HEPA-filtered biosafety cabinets.

Dr. Stump: Cell-based assays enable one or more target-specific measurements amidst thousands of interdependent chemical reactions occurring inside each cell. The end goal is to identify a lead candidate based on a physiologically relevant response. To accomplish this goal, assay design (including the choice of a model system, endpoints specific to the drug target, protocols, and reagents) must be robust. Thus, methods beyond 2D cell culture may be the answer, but they drastically increase the complexity of the assay.

Adequate dynamic range of the assay is also a key challenge since nanomolar inhibitors require at least femtomolar detection for accurate curve generation. Highly specific antibodies can address this issue by substantially increasing the signal-to-noise raio. These and other elements combined must yield a reproducible assay that can achieve the throughputs desired.

Dr. Charrier-Savournin: Immortalized cell lines have been extensively used since they are cost effective and easy to manipulate genetically. However, they are not representative of normal cells, so their use for screening assays becomes outdated. Closer to native pathophysiology are fully differentiated primary cells, cancer cells, embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells, but they are less available, more difficult to maintain and differentiate, and more costly.

Thus, cell-based assays need to adapt. They can become more sensitive, use less sample, or even work on endogenous expression while keeping the characteristic advantages of high-throughput screening, which include robustness, ease of use, and miniaturization. Highly sensitive detection technologies, such as homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays, have evolved to combine both requirements and are now fit to measure endogenous events in a screening environment.

Ms. Gitschier: Cell-based assays provide a biologically relevant environment, are amenable to high-throughput screening, and do not require the complexity and risk of whole-organism testing. A major challenge of cell-based assays involves choosing an ideal assay to represent the system of interest, while maintaining consistency and reproducibility. Cell culture and plating techniques, the use of automation, and microplate selection can be optimized to reduce variability.

Specifically for high-throughput screening, evaporation and small-volume use are concerning. For these assays, microplate seals, low-evaporation lids, and specialty microplates are useful. Finally, having vendors of instruments and microplates work closely together as technologies advance to ensure compatibility can help alleviate challenges customers face when adopting a new assay to meet their high-throughput drug discovery needs.

Dr. Collins: To more closely mimic disease, researchers are increasingly faced with the need to develop cell-based assays that accurately reflect the environment of the human body. Scientists are studying 3D spheroids as a biologically relevant model that accurately replicates the in vivo environment. For example, variable aperture confocal technology on the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 is instrumental in optimally imaging these challenging samples.

Another difficulty in developing better biological models is preparing samples in a miniaturized format. A common solution is round-bottom plates, which require a robust autofocus algorithm for automated imaging.

Finally, studies of living biology are critical to understanding dynamic cellular events. Recent speed improvements on the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 enable acquisition of beating cardiomyocytes at 42 frames per second, accurately representing cardiac physiology.

Dr. Mohan: Most high-throughput screening (HTS) in drug development is based on cell-based and biochemical assays. Although cell-based assays are useful for target validation and ADMET, they are not free from challenges. One of the greatest challenges is to develop stable cell lines that express reasonable quantities of target proteins. Another challenge is the decline in the expression level with each passage, which adds difficulty in data interpretation.

Immortalized cell lines, such as HEK293 and cancer cell lines, are widely used, but they can harbor mutations. They may not give true results, that is, results consistent with those obtained with primary native cells. Some of the challenges can be overcome by the use of 3D cell cultures, which emulate in vivo morphology as well as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.

Dr. Chandy: Some of the challenges in using cell-based assays are choosing a cell model that allows throughput and standardizing image analysis and interpretation for complex assays, such as time-lapse or 3D objects. In particular, imaging of 3D models may better predict reactions of or more closely mimic the in vivo environment. Previously, using live cell assays where 3D acquisition was required forced researchers to compromise between resolution and phototoxicity during z-sectioning.

Modern systems, such as the ImageXpress  Micro Confocal system, enable high-resolution screening at the speed of widefield imaging through advanced illumination techniques and optics. Integrated software packages, such as MetaXpress software, allow for multiple cell types, substrates, or cell behaviors to be automatically characterized at once, reducing variability across experiments.

Dr. Khimani: Although cell-based assays offer physiologically relevant systems for drug discovery, they traditionally provide output in just one dimension. Such output may miss effects such as molecular, morphological, and other phenotypic changes that could challenge further development of a drug candidate.

Instead, cell-based strategies including multiparametric and multianalyte readouts at the subpopulation- or the single-cell level should be considered. Multimode and multianalyte analysis tools that detect changes in a spatial context are critical in determining both the efficacy and toxicity of a drug candidate as well as better downstream outcomes. Furthermore, current advances and continued development and integration of 3D cellular models, simultaneous detection, imaging, and data analysis capabilities will further enable high-content drug discovery.

Dr. Riss: In general, the biology of the high-throughput assay system contributes more to variability than the chemistry of the detection reagents. Perhaps the biggest challenge for cell-based high-throughput screening is having uniform samples of cells in assay wells at the time the measurements are made. Variability in dispensing and culturing small numbers of cells in low-volume plates often leads to edge effects that result in variability among replicate samples.

One way to address variability is to multiplex assays to include controls to normalize data to the total or viable number of cells in the sample.

Dr. Horton: As our understanding of complex cellular systems evolves, there is a driving force to move to more predictive cellular models for drug discovery. What was incomprehensible from a bioinformatics and screening perspective just five years ago is quickly becoming the new screening norm. Traditional workhorse cell models (such as HEK293 and CHO-K1) are taking a back seat to more complex 3D cellular systems and patient-derived disease models.

The challenge to reagent suppliers is to identify and develop robust assays readouts that will function in a range of cellular backgrounds and environments while still providing physiologically relevant information.

With the adoption of single-use bioprocess equipment reaching a turning point in terms of acceptance, industry has taken a more neutral perhaps philosophical is a better term stand regarding the relative merits of stainless steel and plastic. The arguments and rivalries faded long ago.  There are compelling business reasons for either one,  notes Brady Cole, vice president, commercial operations, ABEC.  We take the same custom approach to single-use manufacturing equipment as we have for stainless for over 40 years. 

Bioprocessors must still perform due diligence when specifying new bioreactor capacity. Production scale and economics remain pertinent issues. Yet if anything, adoption of single-use equipment has had a positive effect on how the industry views stainless-steel equipment. Paraphrasing Mark Twain, Cole notes that  reports of the death of stainless-steel equipment have been greatly exaggerated.  Companies are still using large stainless-steel bioreactor tanks in new facilities, and despite rises in titers for many products, tank sizes have remained in the 10 kL to 20 kL working volume range.

Larger volumes plus higher titers have generated bottlenecks here and there for downstream operations, but these problems are solvable through appropriate engineering approaches. At the same time, a renewed focus on product quality has provided parallel quality incentives for manufacturers of stainless-steel equipment.  We need to align our products with customers  quality systems,  Cole adds.

To that end, he sees a rededication to lifecycle documentation, and  a lot more  qualification at the bioreactor production facility rather than at user sites.  That makes a huge impact on quality as well as a scheduling advantage,  Cole insists.  If you go through installation and operation qualification (IQ/OQ) at ABEC, you will decrease your schedule risk and increase your chance of achieving high levels of quality during operation.

360,Antidepressants Slow to  Kick In  Because of Laggard G Proteins," 
	It is common knowledge that antidepressants can take weeks or even months to start working. But it has been a mystery why antidepressants take so long to take effect. But now there is a ray of light in the darkness. The slowness with which antidepressants take effect has been correlated with the slowness of a mechanism quite apart from the binding of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, with serotonin transporters. This binding can occur within minutes. SSRIs, it turns out, also act through another process, the redistribution of G proteins, the slowness of which correlates with the delay in lifting depression through SSRIs. 
 
	The new finding comes from researchers based at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The new finding comes from researchers based at the University of Illinois at Chicago. These researchers, led by neuroscientist Mark Rasenick, Ph.D., long suspected that the delayed drug response involved certain signaling molecules in nerve cell membranes called G proteins. Previous research by Dr. Rasenick s group showed that in people with depression, G proteins tended to congregate in lipid rafts, areas of the membrane rich in cholesterol. Stranded on the rafts, the G proteins lacked access to a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which they need in order to function. The dampened signaling could be why people with depression are ""numb"" to their environment, Dr. Rasenick reasoned.

In the lab, Dr. Rasenick bathed rat glial cells, a type of brain cell, with different SSRIs and located the G proteins within the cell membrane. He found that SSRIs accumulated in the lipid rafts over time and as they did so, G proteins in the rafts decreased.

Details of this work appeared July 18 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, in an article entitled,  Antidepressants Accumulate in Lipid Rafts Independent of Monoamine Transporters to Modulate Redistribution of the G protein, G  . 

 Since antidepressants appear to specifically modify G  localized to lipid rafts, we sought to determine whether structurally diverse antidepressants, accumulate in lipid rafts,  wrote the article s authors.  Sustained treatment of C6 glioma cells, which lack 5HT [5-hydroxytryptamine, or serotonin] transporters, showed marked concentration of several antidepressants in raft fractions, as revealed by increased absorbance and by mass fingerprint. 

The scientists noted that closely related molecules that lacked antidepressant activity did not concentrate in raft fractions. Following up on this observation, the scientists determined that at least two classes of antidepressants accumulate in lipid rafts and effect translocation of G  to the nonraft membrane fraction where it activates the cAMP-signaling cascade.

""The process showed a time-lag consistent with other cellular actions of antidepressants,"" said Dr. Rasenick. ""It's likely that this effect on the movement of G proteins out of the lipid rafts toward regions of the cell membrane where they are better able to function is the reason these antidepressants take so long to work.""

""Determining the exact binding site could contribute to the design of novel antidepressants that speed the migration of G proteins out of the lipid rafts, so that the antidepressant effects might start to be felt sooner.""

The authors of the article concluded that analysis of the structural determinants of raft localization could not only help to explain the hysteresis of antidepressant action, but also lead to design and development of novel substrates for depression therapeutics.

Dr. Rasenick already knows a little about the lipid raft binding site. When he doused rat neurons with an SSRI called escitalopram and a molecule that was its mirror image, only the right-handed form bound to the lipid raft. ""This very minor change in the molecule prevents it from binding,  explained Dr. Rasenick,  so that helps narrow down some of the characteristics of the binding site.""",Pharma,Pharma,"molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate,rasenick bathed rat glial cells,delayed drug response involved,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,nerve cell membranes called,doused rat neurons,ssri called escitalopram,c6 glioma cells,lipid raft binding site,right-handed form bound,lack 5ht [5-hydroxytryptamine,lacked antidepressant activity,showed marked concentration,closely related molecules,nonraft membrane fraction,neuroscientist mark rasenick,work appeared july 18,exact binding site,structurally diverse antidepressants,commonly prescribed antidepressants,lipid rafts independent,proteins lacked access,cell membrane,brain cell,serotonin] transporters,serotonin transporters,binding site,lipid raft,molecule prevents,raft fractions,raft localization,antidepressant effects,group showed,antidepressant action,signaling molecules,lipid rafts,membrane rich,rasenick&rsquo,rasenick reasoned,mass fingerprint,minor change,specifically modify,common knowledge,biological chemistry,time-lag consistent,increased absorbance,dampened signaling,grantidepressants slow,news highlightsit,scientists determined,felt sooner,cellular actions,helps narrow,structural determinants,rafts decreased,sustained treatment,monoamine transporters,previous research,mirror image,scientists noted,camp-signaling cascade,start working,article concluded,process showed,article entitled,depression therapeutics,lifting depression,antidepressants slow,researchers based,long suspected,modulate redistribution,proteins tended","Following up on this observation, the scientists determined that at least two classes of antidepressants accumulate in lipid rafts and effect translocation of G  to the nonraft membrane fraction where it activates the cAMP-signaling cascade.

Investigators studying the underlying biology of KRAS in lung cancer determined that activity resulting from the ACSL3 gene is essential for these lung cancer cells to survive, and that suppressing ACSL3 causes these lung cancer cells to die.

The study (""Fatty Acid Oxidation Mediated by Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain 3 Is Required for Mutant KRAS Lung Tumorigenesis"") appears in Cell Reports.

The findings are significant because genetic mutations of KRAS occur in about 30% of lung cancer cases, and they are associated with aggressive, therapy-resistant disease with a poor prognosis. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

""Despite some recent advances, mutant KRAS remains a very challenging target. There is a dearth of treatment options for tumors initiated by this gene,"" said senior author Pier Paolo Scaglioni, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.

The KRAS gene produces K-Ras proteins that influence when cells divide. Mutations in K-Ras can result in normal cells dividing uncontrollably and turning cancerous.

""Mutant KRAS not only promotes the growth of tumors, but also the survival of established lung cancer. Since we have no clinically relevant effective inhibitors of mutant KRAS at this time, there has been an intense clinical interest in developing a treatment that is proven effective,"" said Dr. Scaglioni, who leads the Cancer Signaling Laboratory at the Simmons Cancer Center.

The team found that the enzymatic activity of ACSL3 (Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3) is needed for the mutant KRAS gene to promote the formation of lung cancer, and further demonstrated that fatty acids, which are the substrates of ACSL3 enzyme, have a critical role in lung cancer.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as a powerful clinical diagnostic tool expediting molecular stratification, and it is enhancing our knowledge of tumor clonal changes. This article presents feasibility of NGS in the context of targeted therapeutic approaches to cancer.

 We are entering a promising time in cancer treatment, when the accumulated experience in cancer genome sequencing can be put to practical use in clinical practice,  says Shashikant Kulkarni, Ph.D., a professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine, and a senior officer at Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories.  In just five years, NGS went from an experimental laboratory technology to clinically validated diagnostic tool. 

Dr. Kulkarni points to the recent guidelines developed by the Next-Generation Sequencing: Standardization of Clinical Testing (Nex-StoCT) workgroup. Combined with more recent guidelines for bioinformatics, these important principles ensure that results from tests based on NGS are reliable and useful for clinical decisions.

The workgroup was convened by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which expanded its genetic reference testing program to include reference standards for NGS characterization. Complementary efforts are being pursued by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).

For example, NIST s Genome in the Bottle team recently released the first DNA reference materials to gauge the performance of whole-genome and targeted panel sequencing tests. The development of these reference materials assists the FDA s efforts to design a regulatory framework for NGS-based tests.

The Nex-StoCT workgroup has proposed a three-stage validation process: platform, test-specific, and informatics pipeline validation. Such a process, notes Dr. Kulkarni, could increase confidence in the  critical knowledge gained via NGS.

If this hidden compartment could be jammed, it might be possible to halt translation of the growth-promoting proteins, which are especially important to cancer cells, while preserving the translation of other life-critical proteins.

The hidden compartment was uncovered by scientists based at the University of California, Berkeley. It came as a surprise because it occurs in a protein complex, eIF3, that has been known and studied for nearly 50 years. No one suspected its undercover role in the cell. This may be because eIF3's ability to control mRNA translation selectively is turned on only when it binds to the set of specialized mRNAs. Binding between eIF3 and these mRNAs opens up a pocket in eIF3 that then latches onto the end-cap of mRNA to trigger the translation process.

""To me, it's like finding a secret lever that opens a hidden drawer in an old-time desk,"" said Jamie Cate, Ph.D., a UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and of chemistry. ""The desk has been around over one and half billion years and many have studied it for decades, but we figured out how to trigger the opening.""

Dr. Cate led a study that focused on a protein that is part of the eIF3d complex that helps the complex bind to mRNA. The study ( eIF3d Is an mRNA Cap-Binding Protein That Is Required for Specialized Translation Initiation ), which appeared July 27 in Nature, could help explain why translation of many mRNAs that require eIF4E continues, even if eIF4E is inactivated.

 Here we describe a cap-dependent pathway of translation initiation in human cells that relies on a previously unknown cap-binding activity of eIF3d, a subunit of the 800-kilodalton eIF3 complex,  wrote the authors of the Nature study.  A 1.4   crystal structure of the eIF3d cap-binding domain reveals unexpected homology to endonucleases involved in RNA turnover, and allows modelling of cap recognition by eIF3d. 

Essentially, the study points to a secret lever that triggers translation of a special subset of mRNAs perhaps only 500 out of some 10,000 mRNAs produced by a cell. The study adds a new wrinkle to a familiar insight, one that emerged more than 40 years ago, that a so-called initiation protein must bind to a chemical handle on the end of each mRNA to start it through the protein manufacturing plant, the ribosome. Until now, this initiation protein was thought to be eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) for all mRNAs.

Earlier this year, Cate and colleagues discovered that for a certain specialized subset of mRNAs most of which have been linked somehow to cancer initiation is triggered by a different protein in eIF3. Before, that protein was thought to be just one of a dozen or so general initiation factors required for mRNA translation.

Instead, they discovered that eIF3, an assembly of 13 separate proteins, binds to a unique tag found only on this special subset of mRNAs.

""What we found is that another protein, hiding in plain sight for over four decades, can also bind the chemical handle on the end of mRNAs to promote translation,"" noted Dr. Cate. ""It's a component of eIF3 a protein called eIF3d which has never before been connected to binding the handle.""

Subsequent X-ray crystallography of eIF3d revealed the structural rearrangements that must occur when eIF3 binds to the mRNA tag and which open up the secret compartment. The researchers plan further studies using cryoelectron microscopy to locate the actual trigger that opens the compartment.

368,Visualizing the Architecture of Neuronal Transmission Reveals New  Nanocolumn  Structure," 
	 
 
	 A new model of the molecular architecture at points of neuron-to-neuron contact in the brain, based on measuring the location of individual protein molecules at the sites where cell contact is made. Amazingly, proteins in the two cells align with each other to extremely high accuracy, suggesting a protein column spanning the two cells, and assuring that neurotransmitter release occurs with highest probability near the receptors that sense it.  
 
	&nbsp; ",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/visualizing-the-architecture-of-neuronal-transmission-reveals-new-nanocolumn-structure/81253017/,,,"Visualizing the Architecture of Neuronal Transmission Reveals New  Nanocolumn  Structure | News HighlightsThe study of the synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters is a field of scientific research that has seen its fair share of groundbreaking discoveries over the past century. Yet, the intricate details of the structural mechanisms that allow information to traverse the small gaps between cells rapidly, allowing neurons to communicate with each other, has eluded scientists due in no small part to the visual limitations of light microscopy.

However now, researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) have for first time elucidated details about the architecture of the synaptic transmission process. The findings from this new study were published recently in Nature in an article entitled  A Trans-Synaptic Nanocolumn Aligns Neurotransmitter Release to Receptors. 

Synapses are extremely complex molecular machines. But they are also incredibly tiny, spanning only a few nanometers across to allow for a massive number of them to be crammed into a finite space. For instance, it has been estimated that the human brain contains around 100 trillion synapses  each individually and precisely tuned to convey stronger or weaker signals between cells.

To visualize features on this submicroscopic scale, the researchers turned to an innovative technology known as single-molecule imaging, which can locate and track the movement of individual protein molecules within the confines of a single synapse, even in living cells.

 Using localization microscopy,"" the authors wrote, they showed ""that key proteins mediating vesicle priming and fusion are mutually co-enriched within nanometre-scale subregions of the presynaptic active zone. Through development of a new method to map vesicle fusion positions within single synapses in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we find that action-potential-evoked fusion is guided by this protein gradient and occurs preferentially in confined areas with higher local density of Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) within the active zones. These presynaptic RIM nanoclusters closely align with concentrated postsynaptic receptors and scaffolding proteins suggesting the existence of a trans-synaptic molecular 'nanocolumn'. 

This approach allowed investigators to identify an unexpected and precise pattern in the process of neurotransmission. The researchers looked at cultured rat synapses, which are very similar to human synapses in overall structure.

""We are seeing things that have never been seen before. This is a totally new area of investigation,"" explained senior study author Thomas Blanpied, Ph.D., associate professor in the department of physiology at UMSOM. ""For many years, we've had a list of the many types of molecules that are found at synapses, but that didn't get us very far in understanding how these molecules fit together, or how the process really works structurally. Now by using single-molecule imaging to map where many of the key proteins are, we have finally been able to reveal the core architectural structure of the synapse.""

In the new study, the authors describe an unexpected aspect to this architecture that may explain why synapses are so efficient, but also susceptible to disruption during disease. At each synapse, key proteins are organized very precisely across the gap between cells.

""The neurons do a better job than we ever imagined of positioning the release of neurotransmitter molecules near their receptors,"" Dr. Blanpied noted. ""The proteins in the two different neurons are aligned with incredible precision, almost forming a column stretching between the two cells.""

Understanding this architecture will not only help clarify how communication within the brain works, but also will allow researchers to elucidate how many of them fail to function properly in cases of psychiatric or neurological disease. Dr. Blanpied and his colleagues are focusing on the activity of ""adhesion molecules,"" which stretch from one cell to the other and may be important pieces of the ""nanocolumn."" They suspect that if adhesion molecules are not placed correctly at the synapse, synapse architecture will be disrupted and neurotransmitters won't be able to do their jobs. The researchers hypothesize that in at least some disorders, even though the brain has the right amount of neurotransmitter, the synapses don't transmit these molecules efficiently.",Pharma,Pharma,"explained senior study author thomas blanpied,presynaptic rim nanoclusters closely align,key proteins mediating vesicle priming,trans-synaptic nanocolumn aligns neurotransmitter release,extremely complex molecular machines,map vesicle fusion positions,cultured rat hippocampal neurons,extremely high accuracy,presynaptic active zone,eluded scientists due,approach allowed investigators,higher local density,neuronal transmission reveals,cultured rat synapses,news highlightsthe study,time elucidated details,neurotransmitter release occurs,core architectural structure,individual protein molecules,concentrated postsynaptic receptors,scaffolding proteins suggesting,protein column spanning,synaptic transmission process,trans-synaptic molecular,key proteins,synaptic transmission,blanpied noted,cells align,neurotransmitter molecules,protein gradient,occurs preferentially,column stretching,active zones,intricate details,action-potential-evoked fusion,nanocolumn  structure,molecules efficiently,adhesion molecules,molecules fit,visualize features,highest probability,incredibly tiny,past century,groundbreaking discoveries,incredible precision,innovative technology,finite space,works structurally,submicroscopic scale,light microscopy,important pieces,weaker signals,associate professor,published recently,visual limitations,small part,scientific research,confined areas,massive number,nanometre-scale subregions,fair share,maryland school,convey stronger,mutually co-enriched,authors wrote,structural mechanisms,localization microscopy,function properly,small gaps,rab3-interacting molecule,precise pattern,single-molecule imaging,allowing neurons,authors describe,neuron-to-neuron contact,article entitled,molecular architecture,synapses don,human synapses,100 trillion synapses,single synapses,researchers hypothesize,researchers looked,researchers turned,neurological disease,precisely tuned,unexpected aspect,human brain,neurotransmitters won,cell contact,brain works,living cells,cells rapidly,single synapse,release,blanpied","For instance, it has been estimated that the human brain contains around 100 trillion synapses  each individually and precisely tuned to convey stronger or weaker signals between cells.

Editas said its goals with SR-TIGET a joint venture of Italy s Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele entailed developing gene-correction strategies for treating rare diseases, including two indications in the blood and bone marrow.

While not specified in today s announcement, Editas disclosed to investors in an updated presentation this month that its efforts to advance CRISPR-based medicines for blood and bone marrow disorders focuses on hemoglobinopathies as well as engineering T cells in cancer.

The company s blood disorder pipeline includes discovery-phase research programs in several nonmalignant diseases, citing as examples beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.

Beyond blood and bone marrow, Editas  range of disease applications for CRISPR-based medicines also includes the eye (Leber congenital amaurosis 10 and ocular herpes simplex virus HSV), lungs (cystic fibrosis), muscle (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), and liver (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and infectious diseases).

The company last year launched an up-to-$737 million-plus collaboration with Juno Therapeutics to create chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and high-affinity T-cell receptor (TCR) therapies to treat cancer. In May, a nonprofit affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation agreed to pay Editas up to $5 million to support discovery and development of CRISPR/Cas9-based medicines to treat cystic fibrosis.

Today Editas said its collaboration with SR-TIGET is part of its overall HSC and T-cell editing product development strategy for  challenging  disease areas.

At SR-TIGET, research for the collaboration with Editas will be led by its director, Luigi Naldini, M.D., Ph.D., who has specialized in studying lentiviral gene therapy and hematology.

Earlier this year, SR-TIGET and Biogen launched a partnership to develop gene therapies for hemophilia A and B, using a lentiviral gene-transfer vector developed by the Italian joint venture. The vector is designed to target liver cells through direct administration into the body.

372,Putting the Focus Back on Drug Discovery with Co-Sourcing," 
	Success in the pharmaceutical industry is measured by the ability to research, adapt, produce, and deliver key findings and products as rapidly as possible. Achieving these goals within an environment of fluctuating markets and pressure to contain costs is a formidable challenge that requires effective strategies and processes. However, current models for running laboratories are plagued by inefficiencies that lower productivity and ultimately drive up costs ",http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligenceand153/putting-the-focus-back-on-drug-discovery-with-co-sourcing/77900706/,,,"Putting the Focus Back on Drug Discovery with Co-Sourcing | Insight & Intelligence&#153;Because issues in one area of lab function, such as poorly functioning equipment or outdated communication systems, often have a ripple effect that bogs down the entire process of completing research projects. One of the primary benefits of co-sourcing is the ability to address both big-picture and granular operational issues that impact operational overall efficiency and productivity.

Unlike individual contractors with expertise in a single, specialized area, such as software systems or equipment maintenance, the co-sourcing model offers a full range of services that can be deployed as needed to resolve issues causing systemic operational dysfunction.

Key to the success of co-sourcing is the oversight of a dedicated lab project manager, who is the single point of contact for all services. They can help assess and monitor all facets of the laboratory to identify interconnected issues that are impeding operations and reducing productivity, and help pinpoint which services and solutions are necessary to resolve them based on the laboratory s individual needs. On the flip side, insights gleaned from  big picture  assessments can help laboratories avoid the cost of superfluous services that are not necessary.

A lab project manager should be well-versed and qualified to help support higher-level laboratory operations, including asset management, QC, regulatory compliance, business analytics, and optimal use of laboratory space.

Finally, a co-sourcing collaborator that offers start-to-finish relocation services can be a tremendous asset when part or all of a laboratory needs to be transferred to another facility, whether nearby or across the globe. Because of the multiple, complex steps required to dismantle, pack, transport, and set up equipment and systems to a new facility, a co-sourcing collaborator with relocation expertise who is intimately familiar with all aspects of laboratory functions can help plan and streamline every step of the process.

Like art historians examining distinct lines of evidence, scientists based at the University of California, San Diego and the J. Craig Venter Institute scrutinized three independent data sets. Specifically, they looked at brain imaging, twin study, and transcriptomic data to reveal genetic relationships between the lobes of the human cortex. The genetic patterns found by the scientists suggest that the cortical surface is shaped, to a large degree, by genetic factors. Furthermore, these patterns likely reflect underlying anatomical and possibly functional relationships among cortical regions.

These patterns were described July 26 in PLOS Genetics, in an article entitled  Conservation of Distinct Genetically-Mediated Human Cortical Pattern.  The article describes how genetic relationships among 12 cortical surface areas were assessed using brain images and genotype information on 2364 unrelated individuals, brain images on 466 twin pairs, and transcriptome data on six postmortem brains. These very different data sets were analyzed to determine whether consistent and biologically meaningful patterns would emerge.

 We find that the patterns revealed by each data set are highly consistent (p<10 3), and are biologically meaningful on several fronts,  wrote the article s authors.  For example, close genetic relationships are seen in cortical regions within the same lobes and, the frontal lobe, a region showing great evolutionary expansion and functional complexity, has the most distant genetic relationship with other lobes. The frontal lobe also exhibits the most distinct expression pattern relative to the other regions, implicating a number of genes with known functions mediating immune and related processes. 

The current study, which was led by Chi-Hua Chen of the University of California, San Diego, and Nicholas Schork of the J. Craig Venter Institute, reflects one of the first attempts to assess the relationship between the brain s surface patterns and the underlying genetic patterns, using very different types of data. Moreover, the study suggests that both patterns reflect a common evolutionary and developmental pattern of cortical regionalization.

The authors of the current study note that little is known about the degree to which genetic factors may contribute to cortical patterns. They add that genome-wide association studies have found only a small number of genetic variants with effect on human brain structures.

 Although we know that several transcription factors are key players in intrinsic genetic mechanisms of cortical regionalization, especially based on animal data, there is a large knowledge gap regarding our understanding of polygenic contribution by common genetic polymorphisms to human cortical regions,  the authors indicated.  Identifying the specific variants underlying the likely polygenic pleiotropic effects we observed, however, will require further, likely very large-scale, studies. 

 Despite considerable individual variability in the size and folding patterns of the cortex, the overall organizational patterns seem highly consistent,  said Chen.  Our study shows that genetic factors are likely to be important for laying down this basic cortical patterning. The challenge for the future work will be to identify these specific genetic variants.

The Court is set to hold a hearing today on approval of Pfizer s bid, BIND disclosed yesterday. NanoCarrier emerged as the back-up bidder in the auction held Monday and yesterday under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Pfizer s bid is about double its approximately $20 million cash  stalking horse  bid, for which the pharma giant agreed to acquire substantially all BIND assets a bid BIND disclosed on July 1. Two additional bidders emerged as qualified to participate in the auction.

Pfizer is one of BIND s pharma collaboration partners in developing and commercializing a new class of highly selective targeted and programmable therapeutics called Accurins . Pfizer and BIND launched their up-to-$210 million collaboration in April 2013, and last year extended the partnership by agreeing to apply BIND s Accurin technology to optimize the therapeutic potential of two oncology drugs in Pfizer s pipeline.

In addition to Pfizer, BIND has collaborations to develop Accurins ongoing with AstraZeneca, Roche, Merck & Co., Macrophage Therapeutics (a subsidiary of Navidea Biopharmaceuticals), Synergy Pharmaceuticals, PeptiDream, and Affilogic.

NanoCarrier on July 23 confirmed its participation in the auction, citing the potential for expanding its pipeline and acquiring BIND s technology:  Further, we think this could enable the securing of operation centers and human resources in the U.S., strengthening our business overseas, particularly in the U.S. 

BIND filed for Chapter 11 protection on May 1 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The case (16-11084) has been before the bankruptcy court s Chief Judge Brendan L. Shannon.

The Chapter 11 filing came after lender Hercules Technology III demanded accelerated repayment of $14.5 million it said was due under an outstanding loan to BIND.  Our current cash and assets exceed the loan amount, and we are current on our regularly scheduled repayment obligations,  BIND President and CEO Andrew Hirsch stated at the time.

In January, Hirsch was among executives of biotechs engaged in bioproduct R&D or biomanufacturing who discussed their product or technology focus, along with their strategy, at a GEN Roundtable panel held during the J.P.

A group of New York neuroscientists believes this is possible on the basis of their recent discoveries. Researchers from Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), New York State Psychiatric Institute, and NewYork Presbyterian presented data at the Alzheimer's Association's International Conference in Toronto from two studies that suggest the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) may offer a practical, low-cost alternative to other current diagnostic tools for predicting AD.

In one study ""Predictive Utility of Entorhinal Cortex Thinning and Odor Identification Test for Transition to Dementia and Cognitive Decline in an Urban Community Population"" the researchers administered the UPSIT to 397 older adults (average age of 80 years) without dementia in a multiethnic population. Each of the participants also had an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to measure the thickness of the entorhinal cortex the first area of the brain known to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.

After a 4-year follow-up, 50 of the study participants (12.6%) had developed dementia, and nearly 20% had signs of cognitive decline. Interestingly, the researchers found that that low UPSIT scores which indicate decreased ability to identify odors correctly but not entorhinal cortical thickness, were significantly associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Moreover, the investigators found that low UPSIT scores, but not entorhinal cortical thickness, were predictive of cognitive decline, yet entorhinal cortical thickness was significantly associated with the UPSIT score in those who transitioned to dementia.

""Our research showed that odor identification impairment, and to a lesser degree, entorhinal cortical thickness, were predictors of the transition to dementia,"" explained presenting author Seonjoo Lee, Ph.D., assistant professor of clinical biostatistics at CUMC. ""These findings support odor identification as an early predictor, and suggest that impairment in odor identification may precede thinning in the entorhinal cortex in the early clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.""

In the second study ""Both Odor Identification and Amyloid Status Predict Memory Decline in Older Adults"" researchers evaluated the usefulness of the UPSIT and tests that measure the amount of amyloid protein in the brain for predicting memory decline. The team administered the UPSIT and performed either beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in 84 older adults (median age of 71 years). Of these participants, 58 (69%) had mild cognitive impairment.

At follow-up, at least 6 months later, 67% of the participants had signs of memory decline. Testing positive for amyloid with either method, but not the UPSIT score, predicted cognitive decline. However, participants with a score of less than 35 were more than three times as likely to have memory decline as those with higher UPSIT scores.

""Our research suggests that both UPSIT score and amyloid status predict memory decline,"" noted study author William Kreisl, M.D., assistant professor of neurology in the Taub Institute at CUMC and a neurologist at NewYork Presbyterian/Columbia. ""Younger age, higher education, and shorter follow-up may explain why UPSIT did not predict decline as strongly in this study as in previous studies. Although more research is needed, odor identification testing, which is much less expensive and easier to administer than PET imaging or lumbar puncture, may prove to be a useful tool in helping physicians counsel patients who are concerned about their risk of memory loss.""

Currently, clinical diagnostic methods for detecting AD are only able to do so for later stages of AD, when significant brain damage has already occurred. Brain imaging with PET may show the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain years before symptoms appear; however, this method is expensive. Tests such as beta-amyloid detection in cerebrospinal fluid and brain PET imaging of abnormal tau protein are rapidly advancing through research. Adding a rapid, low-cost diagnostic is of extreme value to physicians and patients, as steps to slow the progression of the disease could potentially begin at a much early age.

""Our study adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential value of odor identification testing in the detection of early-stage Alzheimer's disease,"" remarked senior author on both studies D.P. Devanand, M.D., professor of psychiatry at CUMC.

 Sequenom s proven best-in-class technology and strong research complement LabCorp s extensive women s health offering, providing patients and physicians with one source for the most complete range of testing options in women s health, including NIPT and reproductive genetics,  LabCorp Chairman and CEO David P. King said in a statement

However, Sequenom has also had its struggles in recent years, announcing plans in January to eliminate about 20% of its workforce, 110 positions, as well as sell its operations within North Carolina s Research Triangle Park the company this year has been consolidating operations in San Diego and find partners for its noncore assets.

The layoffs and cutbacks were part of a restructuring through which Sequenom has aimed to focus more on its core women's health business, as well as lowering operating costs, improving laboratory efficiency, and boosting organizational effectiveness.

 Over the last 9 months, Sequenom has vastly enhanced its technology, operations, and business prospects. The opportunities this transaction presents are significant and important both for our reproductive health business as well as our liquid biopsy strategy,  Sequenom President and CEO Dirk van den Boom, Ph.D., stated.  Becoming part of LabCorp helps Sequenom reach a much broader market for our innovative testing. 

Sequenom has also tried but failed to reverse federal court decisions invalidating a key patent for its noninvasive prenatal DNA test, No. 6,258,540. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) upheld a lower court s invalidation of the patent, agreeing with a lower court that it was unenforceable. The ruling upheld a 2013 decision by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that sided with Ariosa Diagnostics, which was acquired last year by Roche for up to $625 million.

A Sequenom petition to review those earlier decisions was denied last month by the U.S. Supreme Court.

LabCorp has formed an acquisition subsidiary, Savoy Acquisition Corp., that will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Sequenom for $2.40 per share, or about $302 million. After completion of the tender offer, LabCorp expects to complete a merger of Savoy and Sequenom in which shares of Sequenom not purchased in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive the same cash price per share as paid in the tender offer.

The tender offer and the merger are subject to customary closing conditions that include acquisition by Savoy of a majority of Sequenom s outstanding shares, and the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

Sequenom s board has approved the deal and has recommended that Sequenom s stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares.

Dave is well suited to help Lilly capitalize on the opportunities before it, as well as to confront the inevitable challenges that lie ahead. He will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. 

Ricks is now svp and president, Lilly Bio-Medicines, a position he has held since January 2012. Lilly Bio-Medicines encompasses the therapeutic areas of Alzheimer's disease, urology, immunology, musculoskeletal disease, and pain, as well as the company's global marketing function.

Ricks' successor as president of Lilly Bio-Medicines will be announced at a later date, Lilly said.

In addition to president and CEO, Ricks will also become Lilly s chairman on May 31, when Dr. Lechleiter leaves the position and the company s board. That transition will cap Dr. Lechleiter s 38-year career at the company, which began when he joined Lilly in 1979 as a senior organic chemist in process research and development.

Dr. Lechleiter advanced during the mid-1980s to director of pharmaceutical product development for the Lilly Research Centre Limited in England. He later held roles in project management, regulatory affairs, product development, and pharma operations before being named president and COO in 2005, joining the company s board of directors.

Dr. Lechleiter became CEO in April 2008, and chairman in January 2009. During his tenure, Lilly was forced to confront the patent cliff expiration of several top-selling drugs including the antidepressant Cymbalta  (duloxetine hydrochloride), and the osteoporosis drug Evista  (raloxifene hydrochloride). In 2013, Lilly laid off about 1000 U.S. sales representatives in anticipation of revenue declines

Last year, however, the company reported much better news, namely six FDA approvals, and the launches of Cyramza (ramucirumab) for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); the once-weekly type 2 diabetes treatment Trulicity (dulaglutide); another type 2 diabetes treatment, Jardiance (empagliflozin); and Basaglar (insulin glargine injection), indicated for both adults and childen with type 1 diabetes and for adults with type 2 diabetes.

During the second quarter, those and other launches accounted for 10% pharmaceutical volume growth that drove a 9% increase in revenues over Q2 2015. Lilly finished Q2 with net income of $747.7 million, up 24% from the year-ago quarter, on revenue that grew to $5.4 billion.

Lilly said yesterday its R&D effort has the potential to launch 20 new products in the period from 2014 2023.

 Lilly is in the midst of one of the most productive periods of new product launches in our company's history, with new medicines making a substantial contribution to our revenue growth for the first half of the year,"" Dr. Lechleiter said in a statement accompanying the Q2 results.

Ricks joined Lilly in 1996 as a business development associate, then held several management roles in U.S. marketing and sales before moving to Lilly Canada, where he served successively as director of pharmaceutical marketing, national sales director, and general manager. He was later named president and general manager of Lilly China before becoming president of Lilly USA in 2009.

 Lilly has the right strategy. We've built a strong pipeline and have a promising portfolio of recently approved new medicines.

	Senior study author Qin Y",http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/new-gene-editing-tool-zeros-in-on-multiple-genes-simultaneously/81253005/,,,"New Gene-Editing Tool Zeros in on Multiple Genes Simultaneously | News HighlightsScientists at Yale have designed a system to modify, or edit, multiple genes in the genome simultaneously, while also minimizing unintended effects. The gene-editing ""toolbox"" provides a user-friendly solution that scientists can apply to research on cancer and other disciplines, the researchers said.

Their study ( An Easy and Efficient Inducible CRISPR/Cas9 Platform with Improved Specificity for Multiple Gene Targeting ) appears in Nucleic Acids Research.

With modern genetic engineering techniques, such as the recently developed CRISPR technologies, researchers can edit genes in experiments. This rapidly evolving field allows researchers to study important disease-related genes and may ultimately allow them to treat genetic diseases by making edits in specific sites of the human genome. However, progress has been hampered by several challenges, including the editing of unintended sites, referred to as off-target effects.

Senior study author Qin Yan Ph.D., and his co-authors at the Yale School of Medicine tackled these challenges in multiple ways. In previous systems, the genome-editing machinery was constantly turned on, leading to more off-target effects. To avoid these effects, the team first developed a strategy to make the machinery inducible, i.e., able to be turned on and off. They used a drug to turn the machinery on just long enough to edit the genes. This approach allowed them to activate the machinery as needed and for a limited amount of time, reducing off-target effects, they said.

Their gene-editing system also contained a fluorescent marker so the researchers could track whether the editing enzyme was turned on or off in cells, noted Dr. Yan, who is an associate professor of pathology and member of Yale Cancer Center.

The next step was to make the process of gene editing less complex and time-consuming than previous systems. To target multiple genes simultaneously, the research team developed a simple strategy to put multiple targeting sequences in one step. Each targeting sequence allows the editing machinery to recognize one gene.

With the combined gene-editing strategies (the toolbox) the researchers focused on a group of three cancer-related genes. In experiments using both cultured cells and animal models, they simultaneously deleted all three genes.

""This toolbox can be used for inducible and multiple-gene targeting,"" said Dr. Yan. ""We streamlined what used to be a very complicated process, making it more efficient and much simpler to edit several genes at once major advantages that other systems do not have.""

The design of the system also allowed the team to conduct their work in a condensed period of time. ""This toolbox will shorten our experiments significantly, from a month to a week.

380,Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine," 
	A recent article 1  focused attention on the proliferation of unregulated clinics in the U.S. that promise stem cell cures. The term &ldquo;stem cell&rdquo; used to have meaning only to scientists. It referred to cells that can both make new copies of themselves and turn into different types of mature cells. 
 
	Stem cell is a fitting term for the cells in bone marrow that are transplanted to people in an attempt to save them from leukemia. Bone marrow transplants require killing a patient&rsquo;s own cancerous bone marrow and replacing it with cells that produce all the types of blood cells found in the body. A bone marrow transplant to replace the blood system is the only stem cell therapy that is FDA approved as being safe and effective. 
 
	But investments like California&rsquo;s $3 billion for stem cell research in 2004 and similar efforts worldwide have added stem cell to the vocabulary of a growing number of people. Positive press from funding agencies has raised not only the pu",http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligenceand153/stem-cells-and-regenerative-medicine/77900703/,,,"Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine | Insight & Intelligence&#153;Since there is no scientific basis for their treatments, the clinics use patient testimonials and patient ratings to give the illusion that there is a medical benefit to their activities. The testimonials say that the patients are satisfied, they trust the organization, and they would recommend the treatment to others. But this is not science, and these are not verifiable clinical milestones and outcomes. This is advertising.

It is important to understand the role of the FDA in regulating stem cell therapies at these clinics. The FDA has made it clear that two characteristics of a stem cell treatment make it subject to FDA regulations. First, any manipulation of a harvested tissue (separation of cells from fat or culturing or concentrating bone marrow cells) gives the treatment status as a drug. Second, taking cells from one location (such as fat) and putting them into another location, such as the bloodstream, also means that the cells must be regulated as a drug.

The FDA has been slow to enforce their oversight of these clinics by any meaningful action, and this regrettably has, if not condoned, permitted the proliferation of sites offering perceived unregulated stem cell treatments. But happily this is changing. At the World Stem Cell Summit in 2015, Robert Califf, M.D., the FDA Commissioner, told the gathering of scientists, clinicians, and patient advocate attendees that the FDA is willing to consider complaints about any specific clinic. The contact information is here: http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/

There is another opportunity to let the FDA know our opinions. In September, the FDA will hold a public hearing on their proposed changes to regulations of stem cell therapies3. This meeting, called  Part 15 Hearing on Draft Guidances Relating to the Regulation of HCT/Ps [Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products],  will be held at the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, MD. There are 54 clinics or organizations scheduled to speak at this meeting and forty individuals. All of the speakers will have 5 minutes. One of us (Loring) will speak on September 13 (2:34-2:39 pm).

What else can be done? Since the public is the victim of these clinics, anyone invested in the development and implementation of legitimate therapies must get involved to curtail these opportunists whose money-making ventures not only may be harmful but jeopardize by association the real potential of stem cell research in regenerative medicine. Previous attempts to expose such clinics have been if not silenced at least muffled by the threat of legal action. We in turn need to turn to the law to safeguard the future of regenerative medicine.

Clinics often make patients sign agreements not to disparage them as a condition of providing the treatment. This makes it difficult for individuals to sue the clinics for failing to provide a therapy that has the positive effects advertised, though there has already been a precedent. A product liability lawsuit has been filed against one such U.S. clinic4. The high costs of these treatments, from $10,000 to $100,000, should motivate individuals seeking these therapies to ask for some guarantee or at least the right to seek recourse in the event of harm or non-provision of goods as promised.

The public has a major role to play in the protection of regenerative medicine.

A patented combination of the FDA-approved drugs the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone and the benzodiazepine oxazepam, EMB-001 targets the stress response system as a novel approach to addressing addiction and relapse.

EMB-001 is based on the discoveries of Nicholas Goeders, Ph.D., professor and head of the Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology & Neuroscience at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Health Sciences Center.

LSU has exclusively licensed the candidate to Embera, which in January announced it had successfully completed a Phase I study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of EMB-001 in healthy adult smokers.

In that study, EMB-001 showed itself to be safe and well-tolerated, with a statistically significantly greater effect compared with Chantix  (varenicline). Results from the Phase I study were presented at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco in February, and at other scientific conferences in the first half of 2016.

In 2012, Embera published results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical study of EMB-001 in cocaine-dependent subjects. EMB-001 treatment significantly reduced cocaine use compared to placebo, produced significant reductions in cocaine craving, and was well tolerated over the 6-week treatment period.

The candidate s potential use for addictions to nicotine and methamphetamine, as well as cocaine, has been shown in preclinical studies, while clinical activity was also demonstrated in a pilot study in cocaine-dependent human subjects, according to Embera.

By delivering therapy locally, releasing tiny amounts of drug to a tumor site, the new patch can avoid the side effects that often accompany systemic treatments. And though the amounts of drug delivered may be said to be  tiny,  they are, effectively, more concentrated.

Thus far, the patch has been used in an animal model of colon cancer, which is often treated surgically, even though surgical interventions often fail to remove tumors completely, leaving open the possibility of recurrence and metastasis. While many patients remain cancer-free for months or even years after surgery, tumors are known to recur in up to 50% of cases.

To prevent the recurrence of tumors after surgery, conventional therapies such as chemotherapy fail to differentiate sufficiently between healthy and cancerous cells. Hence the adverse side effects. Also, with systemically administered treatments, only a small portion of the drug reaches the tumor site itself, meaning that the primary tumor is not treated as effectively as it should be.

 [We tend to treat] both the source of the cancer the tumor and the metastases resulting from that source, in a suboptimal manner,  said Natalie Artzi, Ph.D., a research scientist at MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who led the effort to develop the new patch.  That is what prompted us to think a little bit differently, to look at how we can leverage advancements in materials science, and in particular nanotechnology, to treat the primary tumor in a local and sustained manner. 

Dr. Artzi and her colleagues described their work in an article that appeared July 25 in the journal Nature Materials, in an article entitled,  Local Triple-Combination Therapy Results in Tumour Regression and Prevents Recurrence in a Colon Cancer Model.  The article detailed how the researchers used a prophylactic hydrogel patch to deliver a combination of gene, drug, and phototherapy in a colon cancer mouse model. The patch, the scientists reported, led to  complete tumour remission when applied to nonresected tumours and to the absence of tumour recurrence when applied following tumour resection. 

 The adhesive hydrogel patch enhanced the stability and provided local delivery of embedded nanoparticles,  the authors added.  Spherical gold nanoparticles were used as a first wave of treatment to deliver siRNAs against Kras, a key oncogene driver, and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles mediated the conversion of near-infrared radiation into heat, causing the release of a chemotherapeutic as well as thermally induced cell damage. 

The researchers envision that a clinician could remove the tumor, and then apply the patch to the inner surface of the colon, to ensure that no cells that are likely to cause cancer recurrence remain at the site. As the patch degrades, it will gradually release the various therapies.

Dr. Artzi asserted that the patch can also serve as a neoadjuvant, a therapy designed to shrink tumors prior to their resection.

When the researchers tested the treatment in mice, they found that in 40% of cases where the patch was not applied after tumor removal, the cancer returned. But when the patch was applied after surgery, the treatment resulted in complete remission. Indeed, even when the tumor was not removed, the triple-combination therapy alone was enough to destroy it.

Their local, triple-combination approach to cancer therapy, the MIT scientists concluded, can be adapted to other cancer cell types and to molecular targets associated with disease progression. ""This administration modality would enable, at least in early-stage cancer patients, the avoidance of open field surgery and colon resection,"" emphasized Dr. Artzi.

This novel strategy was tested in with genetic diseases, such as aplastic anemia and pulmonary fibrosis, which have known mutations in the telomerase gene. The researchers believe that the approach they took in this new study may help combat the damage caused to patients by telomerase deficiency.

""One of the processes associated with aging is a progressive shortening of telomeres, DNA-protecting structures at the ends of chromosomes, like the plastic tips on shoelaces,"" explained co-author Rodrigo Calado, M.D., Ph.D., professor at the University of S o Paulo's Ribeir o Preto Medical School (FMRP-USP). ""Each time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter. Eventually, the cell can't replicate anymore and dies or becomes senescent. However, telomerase can keep the length of telomeres intact, even after cell division.""

Scientists often use telomere length as a laboratory measure of a cell's age. Interestingly, some cells avoid aging by using telomerase to lengthen their telomeres through the addition of DNA sequences, thereby maintaining their capacity to multiply and ""stay young.""

Embryonically, where tissues are still in their formative stages, telomerase is expressed by practically every cell. After this period, only cells that are constantly dividing, such as hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells, which can differentiate into a variety of specialized cells, continue to produce telomerase.

""Aplastic anemia is one of the diseases that can be caused by telomerase deficiency,"" Dr. Calado noted. ""Bone marrow stem cells age prematurely and fail to produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, making the patient dependent on blood transfusions and more susceptible to infections.""

Previous work done by Dr. Calado and his colleagues showed that androgens, which are converted into estrogens in humans, bound to female hormone receptors in the telomerase gene promoter region and thereby stimulated expression of the enzyme in cells.

""The study we've just published was designed to find out whether the effect we'd observed in the lab also occurred in humans, and the results indicate that it does,"" Dr. Calado remarked.

The findings from this study were published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine in an article entitled  Danazol Treatment for Telomere Diseases. 

Instead of estrogen, the researchers treated the patients with the androgen danazol, a synthetic male hormone, because it has long been used as a drug in cases of congenital anemia and offers the advantage of stimulating an increase in the mass of hemoglobin (red blood cells), which estrogen cannot do. Treatment with this steroid was tested for 2 years in 27 patients with aplastic anemia owing to telomerase gene mutations.

""In a healthy adult, telomere length varies from 7000 to 9000 base pairs on average. A normal person's telomeres lose 50 to 60 base pairs per year, but a patient with telomerase deficiency can lose between 100 and 300 base pairs per year,"" stated Dr. Calado. ""In the patients who received danazol, telomere length increased by 386 base pairs on average over 2 years.""

Additionally, the researchers found that hemoglobin mass rose from 9 grams per deciliter (g/dL) to 11 g/dL on average. A person without anemia normally has between 12 and 16 g/dL, but the improvement observed in these subjects was sufficient to rid them of transfusion dependency.

""On completion of the protocol, the medication was interrupted, and we observed a fall in all counts. Several patients resumed the medication with smaller doses, individually adjusted to minimize side effects,"" Dr. Calado said.

In a new protocol currently in progress at the University of S o Paulo's Ribeirao Preto Blood Center, the same kind of approach is being tested with nandrolone, an injectable male hormone.

While the results of the current study suggest that drugs can be used to reverse one of the biological drivers of aging, it is not yet clear whether the benefits of such treatment would surpass the risks in healthy people, especially if the treatment involves the use of sex hormones.",Pharma,Pharma,"bone marrow stem cells age prematurely,telomerase enzyme providing potential therapeutic avenues,providing potential therapeutic avenues,male hormone reverses cell aging,ribeirao preto blood center,explained co-author rodrigo calado,telomerase gene promoter region,article entitled  danazol treatment,synthetic male hormone,injectable male hormone,female hormone receptors,preto medical school,male sex hormones,minimize side effects,cells avoid aging,red blood cells,white blood cells,telomerase enzyme&mdash,telomerase enzyme&rsquo,news highlightsthe impact,telomere length increased,telomere length varies,current study suggest,aplastic anemia owing,hemoglobin mass rose,telomerase gene mutations,stem cells,telomerase enzyme,sex hormones,telomerase gene,blood transfusions,telomere length,received danazol,specialized cells,androgen danazol,telomerase deficiency,telomere diseases,cell divides,cell biology,cell division,cell cycle,aplastic anemia,biological drivers,protein utilizes,stimulate production,molecular mechanisms,transfusion dependency,constantly dividing,9000 base pairs,60 base pairs,replicate anymore,england journal,previous work,pulmonary fibrosis,stay young,individually adjusted,300 base pairs,laboratory measure,dna sequences,plastic tips,healthy adult,stimulated expression,healthy people,formative stages,progressive shortening,treatment involves,colleagues showed,congenital anemia,smaller doses,youth&rdquo,dna-protecting structures,386 base pairs,nobel prize,produce telomerase,calado noted,genetic diseases,calado remarked,damage caused,recent study,normal person,age,published recently,patient dependent,youth  molecule,telomeres intact,improvement observed,researchers found,researchers treated,stated dr,patients resumed,enzyme,aging,telomeres lose 50,cells,telomerase,cell,length,impact","""On completion of the protocol, the medication was interrupted, and we observed a fall in all counts.

UC acted on behalf of UCLA in licensing the technology to Kite. This technology is based on research led by Gay M. Crooks, M.D., a co-director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center and director of the Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program at UCLA s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Dr. Crooks has developed and refined an artificial thymic organoid (ATO) cell culture system designed to replicate the human thymic environment  to support efficient ex vivo differentiation of T cells from primary and reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells.

According to Kite, the ATO system potentially supports efficient and scalable production of T cells using pluripotent stem cell lines capable of indefinite self-renewal. By contrast, attempts to generate T cells with in vitro cell culture systems have been limited by low output of T cells and donor-to-donor variability that cannot support further engineering or commercial-scale manufacturing.

By facilitating reproducible and consistent production of T cells, the ATO system presents an attractive platform to facilitate additional gene-engineering steps to develop off-the-shelf allogeneic T cell therapies, Kite reasons.

 This platform provides a renewable source of T cells and can be further exploited with gene engineering, including chimeric antigen receptors, T-cell receptors, and other gene modifications of interest, to generate potent T-cell products that have the potential to be resistant to rejection and to bear no risk of graft-versus-host disease,  David Chang, M.D., Ph.D., Kite s evp, R&D, and CMO, said in a statement.

JNJ-64041757 (formerly ADU-214) is an antigen-presentation therapeutic, based on a live attenuated double-deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes cancer immunotherapy expressing mesothelin and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII). Now in Phase I clinical development for lung cancer, JNJ-64041757 is an antigen-presentation therapeutic engineered to induce an immune response against NSCLC tumors.

The partnership is the second announced in as many days by BMS that is aimed at studying Opdivo with other immuno-oncology treatments. Just yesterday, BMS and AbbVie launched a clinical collaboration that will assess combinations of AbbVie s Rova-T (rovalpituzumab tesirine) with Opdivo and an immuno-oncology regimen combining Opdivo with another marketed BMS immune-oncology treatment, Yervoy  (ipilimumab), in patients with relapsed extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Had the cells been the same, the exposure to chemicals would have produced similar results in the cells.

Instead, identical experiments in two different laboratories, one at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and another at Brown University, produced different results, even when the researchers swapped out the cells and replicated their experiment to rule out issues at the respective laboratories. Upon further testing, however, the scientists discovered that the cells had been genetically different from the time they acquired them.

Researchers have long worked under the assumption that cells purchased from the same lot of a cell bank are clones. The reliability of cells is the foundation of much scientific research.

The findings (""Genetic Variability in a Frozen Batch of MCF-7 Cells Invisible in Routine Authentication Affecting Cell Function""), published online in Scientific Reports, were made by a research team led by scientists at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even if this was one bad batch, the discovery raises uncertainty about the reproducibility of experiments using cells that researchers have assumed were the same and contained the same DNA. For the researchers, the flawed cells cost them several years of work and close to $1 million in NIH funding.

""Every researcher believes that if they use cells from the same line of cells, particularly cells from the same lot of a cell bank, then they have clones that should look and act the same,"" says study leader Thomas Hartung, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the Bloomberg School's departments of Environmental Health Sciences and Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. ""We learned in this study that that is not always the case.""

Cell irregularities are not unprecedented. Last year, Italian researchers reported instances of genetic instability in another tumor cell line from different laboratories. However, they did not detect instability in cells from the same lot from a single cell bank, as the Bloomberg School researchers did. Separately, 3 years ago, an international study using the same cell line as the Bloomberg School researchers, also failed because the cells were inconsistent. This was not traced back to the cell source but blamed on the university laboratories.

The discovery came about when Dr. Hartung and colleagues were performing experiments for the Human Toxome Project, an effort led by Dr. Hartung and taking place at six study centers across the country to understand the toxicity of various chemicals better by testing them on cell cultures.  For this experiment, the researchers worked with cells from the MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) line, a well-established breast cancer line isolated in 1970. It has been used in original research published in more than 23,000 scientific articles. Many cancer cell lines, including this one, are immortalized.

To perform identical experiments at the two different schools, researchers from the Bloomberg School and Brown purchased frozen vials of cells of the same lot from the same cell bank. As a standard precaution to make sure that the cells they'd purchased weren't contaminated with others of a different type, the investigators at each school performed a test that sampled short segments of the genome, called short tandem repeats. The test suggested that the cells were genetically identical.

However, when the researchers began comparing notes from their experiments, they found that cells at the two different schools looked and behaved in vastly different ways, says Dr. Hartung, who also directs the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Bloomberg School. The MCF-7 cells at the Bloomberg School grew flat, with a cobblestone-like appearance, while those at Brown grew in large, heap-like aggregations. When the cells were exposed to estrogen, those at Brown proliferated wildly but those at the Bloomberg School remained static. Further tests at the two schools showed that the different batches of cells produced different amounts of metabolic by-products and had different patterns of gene activation.

As noted above, to rule out whether dissimilarities between the two labs' techniques were responsible for these variations, the schools swapped cells and tried the experiments again--with identical results to the original experiments at the opposite school.

When the scientists performed a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) test to check for genomic differences, they found that the two batches of cells were riddled with variations, presumably the cause for their host of differences. Fortunately, both laboratories had an additional vial of the same lot as obtained from the cell bank in their freezers that they'd never touched. The big surprise: They already showed the same genetic differences, before they'd been exposed to anything.

The findings shed light on a potentially huge problem for the reproducibility of scientific experiments that use tumor cell cultures, according to Dr. Hartung. ""This might explain, why 3 years ago a big international study using this very cell line failed because of lacking reproducibility,"" he points out, adding that the results are a call to action for cell banks to rethink quality assurance procedures. By using detailed genetic testing, such as CGH, cell banks and their scientist customers can be reassured that cells from the same lot are indeed genetically identical, helping to reassure that they'll behave the same in identical experiments.

Dr. Hartung and colleagues have previously called for tighter quality controls. In 2005, he led a team that published recommendations for Good Cell Culture Practice aimed at quality standards for cell banks and researchers. These eventually led to the founding of the International Good Cell Culture Practice Collaboration, which has representatives form organizations and agencies from around the world and is formally launching at EuroScience Open Forum 2016.

One method of studying CRC, as well as other types of cancers, is by creating patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and transplanting them into mice, where researchers can study the cancer s behavior when exposed to a variety of therapeutic modalities and environmental factors. But to do this, obtaining the right quality and quantity of viable malignant tissue is necessary, and that has been a bottleneck.

A group of researchers was able to acquire ten fresh samples of cancerous colorectal tissue along with corresponding blood draws from fully consented patients with late-stage CRC. Correlations will be examined between tumor behavior and circulating biomarkers in the blood to identify better treatment options for CRC as well as companion diagnostic tests that will indicate which patients are most likely to respond to the treatments.

As discovery in medicine evolves, the need for human biospecimens on which to conduct the research will remain essential. As we get closer to our pursuit of treating every patient as an N of 1, multiple questions will need to be answered about different subsets of disease, and how they present uniquely in different patients. As was recently asserted in a New England Journal of Medicine article, acute myeloid leukemia is actually eleven different diseases. From this statement alone, it is not difficult to understand how in order realize the goal of precision medicine, many classes of disease must be studied across individuals with unique demographics, exposures, medical histories, family histories, and social histories.

This was the largest-ever study of familial (inherited) ALS, involved contributions from over 80 researchers in 11 countries, and was led by John Landers, Ph.D., of University of Massachusetts Medical School and Jan Veldink, Ph.D., of University Medical Center Utrecht.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which leads to total paralysis and death, usually within two to five years of diagnosis. While 10% of ALS is familial, meaning it's genetic, the other 90% of ALS cases are considered sporadic, or without a family history. However, it's very likely that genetics contribute, directly or indirectly, to a much larger percentage of ALS cases.

""The discovery of NEK1 highlights the value of 'big data' in ALS research,"" said Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., chief scientist for the ALS Association. ""The sophisticated gene analysis that led to this finding was only possible because of the large number of ALS samples available. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge enabled The ALS Association to invest in Project MinE's work to create large biorepositories of ALS biosamples that are designed to allow exactly this kind of research and to produce exactly this kind of result.""

NEK1 was discovered through a genome-wide search for ALS risk genes in over 1,000 ALS families, and was independently found through different means in an isolated population in The Netherlands. Further analysis in over 13,000 sporadic ALS individuals compared to controls again revealed an overrepresentation of variants in the same gene. The variations discovered in the gene sequence are predicted to lead to gene loss of function.

NEK1 is known to have multiple roles in neurons, including maintenance of the cytoskeleton that gives the neuron its shape and promotes transport within the neuron. In addition, NEK1 has roles in regulating the membrane of the mitochondrion, which supplies energy to neurons and in repairing DNA. Disruption of each of these cellular functions through other means has been linked to increased risk of ALS.",Pharma,Pharma,"ice bucket challenge helped lead,aice bucket challenge helped lead,als ice bucket challenge enabled,als ice bucket challenge donations,news highlightsan international research team,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research&rdquo,global gene sequencing effort,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research,genome-wide association analyses identify,university medical center utrecht,000 sporadic als individuals compared,international research team,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,massachusetts medical school,control muscle movement,affects nerve cells,create large biorepositories,progressive neurodegenerative disease,sophisticated gene analysis,als gene discovery,als risk genes,als research,genome-wide search,considered sporadic,als association,als gene,gene sequence,gene loss,large number,common genes,als biosamples,als samples,als cases,000 als families,als lose,increased risk,therapy development,big data,john landers,repairing dna,including maintenance,cellular functions,involved contributions,spinal cord,project mine,larger percentage,provide scientists,promotes transport,independently found,total paralysis,family history,jan veldink,chief scientist,lucie bruijn,isolated population,potential target","Ice Bucket Challenge Helped Lead to New ALS Gene Discovery

embattled Theranos Inc on Monday presented plans for a new
product and said the blood testing company was working
diligently to rectify all of its outstanding issues involving
its product and laboratory operations. 
           
  ",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/UShealthcareNews/~3/1RpcttiUs-o/usa-healthcare-theranos-idUSL1N1AI1Q6,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 22:56:33 -0400",rbssHealthcareNews,"Theranos CEO faces critics, presents new product plansTheranos Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Holmes speaks on stage at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards where she receives an award, in the Manhattan borough of New York November 9, 2015.

CEO Elizabeth Holmes described new technologies that she said were ""distinct from the operations of our clinical laboratories"" that have come under scrutiny - part of a presentation before some 2,650 scientists at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry meeting in Philadelphia.

Those technologies included a new ""minilab"" product that can run a broad range of tests on a single desktop machine.

It was her first public appearance since the privately held company and Holmes personally were sanctioned by the U.S. government's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Theranos has long been criticized by the medical community for refusing to share information about its technology and Monday's appearance was aimed in part at addressing those concerns.

Among the tests that can be run through the minilab technology is a diagnostic for Zika that Holmes said can detect additional strains of the mosquito-borne virus from blood drops finger-pricked from patients. Zika has spread rapidly across the Americas.

Holmes said the company had sent the Zika results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that the company believed the analysis of blood collected using its finger-prick methodology was as effective as other methods, a comparison also sent to the FDA.

The company, once valued at $9 billion, was founded by Holmes in 2003 to develop an innovative blood testing device that would give quicker results using just one drop of blood.

Theranos ran into trouble after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles beginning last October suggesting the blood-testing devices were flawed and inaccurate.

Holmes last month was barred by U.S. regulators from owning or operating a lab for at least two years and, in a crushing blow, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services revoked a key certificate for its California lab and terminated the facility's approval to receive government payments.

Walgreens Boots Alliance  terminated its relationship with the company in June and closed operations at all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers at its drug stores in Arizona.

Members of the audience applauded several times when doctors on the stage challenged aspects of Theranos technology.

Dr. Stephen Master, a pathologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said much interest in the company stemmed from claims it made which were very broad.

""The evidence you presented fell far short of that,"" Master said to applause.

Prior to introducing Holmes, association president Patricia Jones said the organization does not endorse Theranos. ""We're all aware that there have been some suggestions about whether we'll see some science today and the viability of Theranos technology,"" Jones said.

Holmes, when asked in an interview whether she would consider stepping down because of the sanctions, said they apply to her because she owns more than five-percent of the company, not because she is chief executive. Theranos has taken steps to fix the problems, including hiring a new chief compliance officer and appointing an independent board committee, Holmes said in the interview.

Holmes said she could not give an estimate of how much time it would take for Theranos to fix all its outstanding issues because of the ongoing involvement of regulators.

Theranos runs four patient testing centers in Phoenix, Arizona which continue to generate revenue, Holmes said in the interview. Holmes declined to comment on how much cash Theranos has on hand.",Pharma,Pharma,"product planstheranos chief executive officer elizabeth holmes speaks,update 2-theranos ceo faces critics,wall street journal published,theranos ceo faces critics,weill cornell medical college,medicare & medicaid services revoked,walgreens boots alliance  terminated,innovative blood testing device,association president patricia jones,chief compliance officer,ceo elizabeth holmes,medicare & medicaid services,single desktop machine,detect additional strains,independent board committee,blood drops finger-pricked,clinical chemistry meeting,patient testing centers,receive government payments,stage challenged aspects,outstanding issues involving,privately held company,chief executive,blood testing company,give quicker results,monday presented plans,40 theranos wellness centers,medical community,american association,outstanding issues,product plansphiladelphia,blood collected,clinical laboratories,presented fell,share information,cash theranos,glamour women,key certificate,endorse theranos,october suggesting,manhattan borough,drug stores,blood-testing devices,embattled theranos,science today,theranos runs,ongoing involvement,including hiring,generate revenue,finger-prick methodology,articles beginning,spread rapidly,drug administration,mosquito-borne virus,year awards,audience applauded,crushing blow,theranos ran,working
